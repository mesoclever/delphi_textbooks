DATABASES IN A NUTSHELL
Computers store data for a number of reasons. viz. Instructions that a computer
uses to function, data required in RAM when an application is being used, data
in the form of Images and files that the user’s application requires. The structures
commonly used to store data are: Files and Databases.

Databases are a collection of organised data. Databases are the single most
important tool used to store data by programmers and web developers. It can,
for example, be used to store everything such as, the settings in an application,
text on a website, graphics, status updates, personal messages and comments
on social networks.

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE (DBMS)
Database management software (DBMS) is the software responsible for managing
a database. This includes creating the database and tables and managing data
security. Examples of popular database management software include: Microsoft
SQL Server, Microsoft Access, MySQL and SQLite.

UNIT

1.1

Data collection

In Grade 11, you created a database and manually added some data to your tables. This is a very
ineffective way of adding data to a database and is only suitable for small databases. Instead of using
manual entries, most databases use different techniques to capture data automatically. In this section, you
will learn about a few of these techniques.

FORMS
A web form, is an online interactive page that allows for user input. This page imitates a physical form that
users need to complete. To assist with user input and limit errors, a web form usually contains GUI
components such as:
●●
checkboxes
●●
combo boxes
●●
spinners
●●
drop down lists
●●
text boxes
●●
buttons, and so on.
Web designers can also create quite sophisticated web forms for most online activities such as banking,
shopping and job or enrolment applications by using programmed objects, functions and methods. These
Web forms have changed the way that business is done because it limits paperwork and documentation,
and favours online documentation.

TAGS
Electronic tags transmit a radio frequency from the tag to a tag reader, or vica versa. It transmits the
information to a computer program associated with the tag. Tags can be used to track or identify different
items and are often used in merchandising warehouses, for vehicle tracking, pet tracking, and so on.
Let’s look at some examples of how tags are used.

RFID
RFID stands for radio frequency identification and refers to tiny chips (like those in a phone SIM card) that
can store a few kilobytes of information. When scanned, this information is read and displayed on a
computer. By using the correct software, it could also be added to a database directly.

Figure 1.1: An RFID access card

term 1 I Chapter 1 Database Management I Unit 1.1 Data collection

RFID is used by thousands of businesses across the world. For example, RFID can be used to tag:
●●
all products stored in a warehouse. When an item is removed from the warehouse, it is
automatically scanned and removed from the database.
●●
tools stored in a workshop. This allows the company to track which tools are being used, which
employees are using them, and when the tools are returned.
●●
the tickets of people going to conferences, sports events or concerts. When a registered RFID
chip arrives at the gate, the gates open automatically, and the data on the ticket is added to the
database.
●●
the tickets of people using public transport. For example, the Gautrain uses RFID cards to allow
people to board trains. The trip is recorded on a database, and the cost of the trip is subtracted from
the user’s balance.
●●
all products sold in a shop. When an item is purchased, the RFID tags are scanned and the details
about the product are retrieved and added to the bill. The item can then also be removed from the
shop’s inventory automatically.
A basic RFID reader will only scan the information stored on RFID chips and make them available to a
computer. However, there are many software solutions that will automatically take this information and add
it to a database. These applications may also write additional information to the database, like the date
and time that the RFID chip was scanned and the location.

E-TOLLS AND RFID
In December 2014, South African National Roads Agency Ltd (SANRAL) opened its electronic toll (or
e-toll) system in Gauteng. The goal of the system was to help the government pay for the R20 billion
highway improvement project that had been running since 2007.

Figure 1.2: An e-toll gantry
Motorists had to purchase an e-tag (the RFID chip read by the toll gantry). The system used a combination
of cameras and RFID readers to automatically record the information of any car driving through the gantry.
This information is then stored in a database, which is used to automatically generate an invoice at the end
of each month.

DIGITAL SENSORS
A digital sensor is an electronic or electrochemical sensor, where data conversion and data transmission
are done digitally, for example, temperature, distance, humidity, light. Sensors sense a wide range of
different energy forms like movement, electrical signals, radiant energy, pressure, thermal or magnetic
energy. For example, wireless sensor tags connect events in physical world, for example, motion in an
area, whether a door/window is opened/closed, temperature or humidity exceeding a certain limit, or
smartphones or any Web browsers with internet access.

Activity 1.2
Answer the following questions:
1.2.1 Do some research to find out how this e-toll system automatically detects
information for:

a. vehicles with an e-tag, and
b. vehicles without an e-tags.
Write a short report on how reliable you think this system is.
Discuss ways in which:
i. the system could work, and
ii. how this system could work well.
1.2.2 Can you think of any other situations where RFID chips can be used to automatically
create an invoice?

INVISIBLE ONLINE DATA COLLECTION
Databases form the heart (or memory) of the internet because they store most of the information shown
on websites today.
Databases are especially important on websites where users create the content (like YouTube, Facebook
and Wikipedia), as it would be impossible for a data capturer to add this information manually. Instead,
these websites are set up so that any information entered by users are automatically stored in different
databases. This includes items like status updates, likes, tweets and any videos or pictures the user
uploaded. The databases on computers or mobile phones also store the user’s personal information, such
as their email address, username and password.

A cookie is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The web browser
stores the message in a text file. Each time the browser requests a page from the
server the message is sent back to the server. The cookie identifies users and
could customise web pages for each person. When a person first enters a
website using cookies, they may be asked to fill out a form providing personal
information, which is packaged into a cookie and sent to the browser. The next
time you go to the same website, your browser will send the cookie to the server.
Since this incredibly detailed information is recorded for billions of internet users,
online advertising companies require massive databases with software that can
automatically track users and their activity across web pages.
There are hundreds of different systems that have been designed specifically to
automatically record information in databases, for example credit card payments,
automatic toll gates, cookies and cell phone calls.
In all these examples, software was specifically built to read the information and
record it in a database. This software also allows the companies to create
automatic reports from the database. For example, you may receive a credit card
statement or phone bill at the end of each month. This is a report that your
service provider’s database generates automatically.

TRANSACTION TRACKING

Figure 1.4: Credit card
payments make use of
database transactions

Transaction data (type of transaction, store where transaction occurred, employee
who performed the transaction, customer information, payment information
including signatures if captured) is sent from stores to the corporate database.
Data is stored on cards, such as credit cards, store cards (for example, Jet or
Edgars) and store loyalty cards (for example, Clicks ClubCard, Pick ‘n Pay
SmartShopper card). Some transaction tracking benefits include: consumer
safety when it comes to purchasing toys, cars, food and medication, enhancing
a user’s on-site experience by tracking browsing history and demographic
profiles, fraud detection, and so on. The main disadvantage of transaction
tracking is the unauthorised use of your personal Information.

LOCATION BASED DATA
Location based data is data that provides information about different things that
can be shown on maps. Static location-based data includes data such as
maps with roads, street names, shops, offices and other features, but also
farming information, government buildings and assets, electric distribution
networks with pylons and substations, military information and so on. Non-static
information obtains the position of aeroplanes, tracking transport or stolen
vehicles, personal positioning, satellites, traffic patterns, rhinos and even pets; all
of which are based on input from geographic positioning systems (GPS).

Location based services (LBS) are services that use software applications together with the locationbased databases to deliver a service such as finding the best route to a destination or shop, find the
location or movement of a stolen vehicle, a lost pet, find the characters in the Pokémon GO game or the
places where photographs were taken during a holiday trip.
Smartphones and tablets are also better at location-based computing, which refers to software based on
a user’s location. Examples of location-based computing includes:
●●
Weather applications tell you what the weather in your specific area will be, based on your location.
●●
Food ordering applications can use your location to deliver food directly to you.
●●
Car sharing services, such as, Uber use your phone’s location to find the nearest Uber driver, who
will pick you up and drop you off at the correct location.
The problem with so much data being stored in databases is how to make sense of it and use it. In the
next section, you will see how companies mine databases to improve their decision making.

Data warehousing

A warehouse is a place where you can store a large number of items or products.

WHAT IS DATA WAREHOUSING?
Data warehousing is similar to how factories and distribution companies store
their products in a warehouse in real life. It is a technique for storing data from
more than one database. Unlike most databases, where the data is normalised
and stored in the most efficient manner, data warehousing takes the data from
these databases and stores it in a non-normalised way.
Since the data is not normalised, there may be redundancies and it can use
additional storage space.

Did you know
Normalisation is the
process of refining the
structure of a database to
minimise redundancy and
improve integrity.

The goal of a data warehouse is to make the data available and ready for analysis.

Did you know

It is important to understand that a data warehouse does not contain copies of
the original databases, instead, it is a new database that is created to hold
structured data from multiple sources. A data warehouse is usually opened to
multiple people in different departments of a company. Each of these people can
then access the data and use it to create graphs and reports useful to them.

Data warehousing is a key
tool in business intelligence
(BI), which refers to several
technologies and
applications that are used
to improve business
decision making.

DATA WAREHOUSING VS DATABASE
Data warehouses and databases are similar in that they are both relational data
systems. However, they were built to serve different purposes.
●●
A data warehouse stores a large quantity of historical data and all the data
from the various databases are availabe.
●●
A database stores current transactions and enables easy access to specific
transactions for ongoing business processes.

Data mining

WHAT IS DATA MINING?
Data mining is a process used to identify trends and patterns between different
sets of data in large databases. Selecting the right data from such large amounts
of data (called big data) can help show trends and patterns between data sets,
which can improve decision making dramatically. For example:
Marketing: Data mining is used to explore increasingly large databases to improve
market segmentation. By extracting data like customer age, gender, tastes etc.
and looking for patterns and trends between them, it is possible to guess their
behaviour in order to direct personalised loyalty campaigns. Data mining in
marketing also predicts which users are likely to unsubscribe from a service, what
interests them based on their searches, or what a mailing list should include to
achieve a successful reponse rate.

Activity 1.5

Data mining

You have been given access to three massive data sets containing hundreds of thousands
of records. The three data sets are:
●●
Sales information from Amazon, including sales information per product, per product
category and per country.
●●
Number of viewers per televisions show, including information on the time of day and
the demographics of the people watching.
●●
List of tweets from the past year, including the content of the tweet, the hashtags used
and the location the tweet was sent from.
Based on these datasets, complete the following tasks.
1.5.1 Give three questions that would you be interested in answering using these data sets.
1.5.2 Describe how a business owner could you use these datasets to improve their
decision making on the following topics:
a. Women are 50% more likely to purchase your product than men. When should
the business advertise their product on TV?
b. An electronics company is not sure if they should make an affordable electric
toothbrush, or a high-quality expensive toothbrush.
c. A restaurant owner has noticed that people often talk about food on Twitter. How
can he use this information to decide which type of restaurant to open in
Johannesburg?
To make sense of the massive amounts of information available, people need to
follow a basic process.This is called the data mining process.

DATA MINING PROCESS
To mine a database, you will:
●●
extract the relevant data
●●
look for patterns in the data
●●
discover knowledge from the patterns
This section will look at each of these steps in some detail.

term 1 I Chapter 1 Database Management I Unit 1.3 Data mining

11

EXTRACT THE RELEVANT DATA
Animation
Animation showing how
small pieces from different
tables are taken and
combines to create a new
database.

Once you have access to a database, you need to extract the data that will be
useful to you. Many of these databases store incredible amounts of data (such as
the UN database, which contains information for most countries in the world),
and you may only need a small section of that data to answer your questions.
Rather than filtering a massive database the whole time, you use the full database
to create a new database containing only the information relevant to you.
In most situations, data will be extracted from the datasets using SQL. This is a
programming language that was created specifically to manipulate and extract
data from a database. By using SQL queries, users can specify exactly which
data they want to extract. This is done by specifying:
●●
Which fields to extract
●●
Which data table to use
●●
What conditions are used
Only data that meets these requirements will then be extracted to be used for
analysis.

LOOK FOR PATTERNS IN THE DATA
When working with large amounts of data, it is impossible to look at each data
point on its own. Instead, you need to look for patterns in the data that will help
you understand the dataset. As you will see in the later steps, these patterns can
result in knowledge, which is used to make better decisions and develop
strategies.
For example, you may want to determine whether fewer people use the highway
between Pretoria and Johannesburg today than before the Gautrain was built. To
do this, you may find Gautrain project planning data for 2014 and N1 toll gate
data for 2019 and calculate daily and monthly averages that you can then
compare. Based on this analysis, you will know if the Gautrain decreased the
traffic on the N1 or not, and importantly, by how much. This information can then
be used to decide whether or not to build a system similar to the Gautrain system
for Durban or Cape Town, who have similar traffic problems.

Figure 1.7: The Gautrain is a high-speed train traveling between Pretoria and
Johannesburg

12

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

DISCOVER KNOWLEDGE
By identifying these patterns, you have turned an overwhelming amount of
disorganised data into a few useful facts. This allows you to understand what
happened rather than rely on vague uninformed views of people. Once you have
confirmed the situation, informed decisions can be made, or strategies developed.

Example 1.1

Data mining used for Government Social Grants

Social grants are administered by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA).
SASSA is mandated to “ensure the provision of comprehensive social security services
against vulnerability and poverty within the constitutional legislative framework”. Most
social grants are “means tested”, this assesses the value of assets and income. Only a
certain threshold is eligible for a social grant.
To measure the living circumstances of South African households, the Government
conducts an annual General Household Survey (GHS). This is a household survey which
collects big data on education, health, social development, housing, access to services
and facilities, food security, and agriculture.
Using data mining techniques the relevant data that will be useful is extracted. This data
is then analysed (finding patterns) and used to obtain information/ knowledge.
This knowledge can then be used to provide the necessary budget for social grants and
to know what limit to set the threshold or provide reports like:
●●

The number of households receiving at least one form of social grant rose from
29,9% (of the population) in 2003 to 44,3% in 2010, according to the latest
General Household Survey report2 from Stats SA. This rose to 45,5%in 2015.
Further details and analysis on the issue of the growing social welfare net are
available from Stats SA’s Poverty Trends in South Africa report3.

Example 1.2

Data mining used by Facebook

Facebook (and other Web giants) accumulate all our personal data over time. Increasingly, identifiable data collection
is happening in more dimensions than are ever understood by most users. The more data there is in one place, the
more data mining can be done. Over time, and in context of other individual data points, it becomes Big Data.
Using data integration, it’s then mixed with other data sources that, as end-users, we’ll never be aware.
Companies, individuals and Facebook Itself that have access to this data extract the relevant data that Is useful to
them and store it in a smaller database.
Apps, that use data analytics, are used to analyze “friends of friends” comments, textual analysis, online behaviour,
and so on, to compile data about us.
This information/knowledge is then used to: determine our current emotional state, correlate how sad or depressed
someone might be, suggest possible friends etc.

1.4

Caring for and managing data

In this unit, you will learn more about the value of data and how data can be protected.

VALUE OF DATA AND METADATA
Data can be valuable for many different reasons. For example, online shopping websites can charge
owners a fee for placing an advertisement of their house, used car or gym equipment on the website.
However, the only way in which owners will be willing to pay this fee is if the database already contains
many other products. To gather the data needed to sell these products, the website’s creator can ask
sellers to enter the important data for their products on the website, from where it is added to the database.
For a database to be useful, it needs to record and store valuable and useful data. To decide if the data is
valuable to record, you can ask yourself these questions:
●●
n
Will I ever use the data in this field?
●●
n
Will anyone else use the data in this field?
●●
n
What fields do I need specifically for my application?
●●
n
What fields would I need for my application in the future?
Based on these questions, you can determine whether certain types of data are valuable to record and
store in your database. Only data that will potentially be used by you (either now, or in the future) is
valuable. Data that will not be used increases the size of your database without adding value to it.
Once you have determined whether the data itself is valuable, you need to ensure that the data is of a high
quality. The following five characteristics determine the quality of the data.

CHARACTERISTIC

DESCRIPTION

Accurate

This means that the data needs to be both correct and precise.

Consistent

This means that the data in one part of your database should not contradict or differ from the
data in another part of your database.

Current

For the information to be of high-quality, it is important that it is up-to-date. If you fail to keep
your information current, you run the risk that it will no longer be relevant or accurate.

Complete

In a database, incomplete data is almost as bad as inaccurate data. Gaps in the data can
cause the data to be difficult to use, outdated and misleading.

Relevant

Good quality data is relevant to the people who are using it.

HOW TO PROTECT DATA
Databases need to be protected from several different threats, including incorrect data entry, data
corruption, data loss, accidental data deletion, purposeful data deletion and unauthorised access. In the
following sections, you will look at eight tools and techniques that can be used to protect databases from
these threats:
●●
Data validation
●●
Data verification
●●
Data integrity checks
●●
Logging changes
●●
Data warehousing
●●
Access control
●●
Parallel data sets

16

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

Since no single tool offers perfect protection against all threats, most large databases use most or all
these tools.

DATA VALIDATION
Data validation refers to the process in which you check whether the data is accurate, in the correct
format or of the correct type before allowing your database to record it. This ensures that the data in your
database is consistent and accurate. It can also be used to prevent certain types of unauthorised access
(such as SQL injections).
For example, if you are recording data for a government survey, you can use a digit validation to ensure all
people’s ID numbers are exactly 13 digits long. This prevents you from accidentally adding incorrect ID
numbers to the database.

DATA VERIFICATION
Data verification is a manual technique that can be used to make sure that the data on a database is
correct and accurate. There are two main ways to do this:
●●
Full verification which requires that each piece of data that is entered into a database is read and
checked by someone. This, however, can be very time consuming.
●●
Sample verification, in which a randomly selected sample of data is checked to ensure there are
not systematic errors. This can help you to notice errors that occur in all data, but with this method it
is possible to miss small mistakes (like typing errors).

DATA INTEGRITY
When we speak about data integrity, we are referring to the reliability, accuracy and how trustworthy data
is over its entire lifecycle. This ties in with data security because uncorrupted data (integrity) is considered
to be ‘clean data’ that stays unchanged throughout its lifecycle.
Many DBMSs have built-in integrity controls that help to maintain the data integrity. This includes features
such as data validation and access control, but also refers to several automatic maintenance processes
to prevent data corruption and errors from occurring in a database.

LOGGING CHANGES
Logging is the process of recording any changes made by users to a database. While logging does not
directly protect a database from any possible threats, it can discourage people from sabotaging a database
and make it easier to solve any problems once they occur.
This is called creating an audit trail. The audit trail records exactly:
●●
who made the changes
●●
what the user changed
●●
when they made the changes.

DATA WAREHOUSING
Data warehousing is a technique used for storing data from more than one database, it is usually stored
in a way that is secure, reliable and easy to retrieve. While data warehousing is generally not considered
as a security tool, it can help improve data integrity in several ways:
●●
Data warehouses make incorrect data entries or data corruption more visible by allowing data analysis.
●●
Data warehouses can make data loss more visible, allowing the problem to be fixed.
●●
Data warehouses can be used to recover critical data if it is deleted or corrupted.

term 1 I Chapter 1 Database Management I Unit 1.4 Caring for and managing data

17

Data warehouses are also a potential security weakness for databases. Your
database could have all the best security features in the world, and it would not
matter if hackers could simply access your data warehouse.

ACCESS CONTROL
Access control refers to managing and controlling the parts of a database that
users have access to. By limiting the number of people who can change a
database, and by limiting what changes each user can make, you can reduce the
damage that any single user can do to a database. This becomes especially
important when many users have access to your database.
There are three important ways to control access to your data:
●●
Passwords ensure that only the owner of a username can log in with that
username.
●●
User rights determine which tables and fields every username can access,
and what changes (if any) the user can make to these tables. This prevents
others from gaining access to certain data or making changes they are not
authorised to do.
●●
Good database security ensures that the data is secure and that outside
people cannot find other ways to access the database.
For example, by using access control on a large news website, regular guests
may be able to read stories but not change the data. Writers may be able to add
new stories to the website but not add new users or delete stories. Finally, one or
two administrators may be able to add new users or delete stories.

PARALLEL DATA SETS
Backups are the most important tool to protect databases from data loss and
data corruption. To ensure that data has not been corrupted or deleted, the
database is checked at intervals against a perfect copy of it, called a parallel data
set. If there are differences, it means that data was either corrupted or deleted.
A company, like YouTube, would break the database into smaller pieces and have
multiple backups of each piece. In this way you never risk losing the entire
database at once, and even if a database crash occurs, the system can
automatically load an existing backup while creating new backups.

QR CODE

Database backups should be protected as securely as the database itself. There
have been many instances of websites where the database backup, rather than
thecan protect data from data corruption, data loss, accidental deletion and
purposeful deletion.

INTRODUCTION
Data is stored in tables in a database. It can be stored in a single table (called a
flat database – as shown in Figure 2.1) or in multiple connected tables (called a
relational database – as shown in Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.1: Data stored in a single table in a flat database

term 1 I Chapter 2 Database design concepts

23

Figure 2.2: Data stored in multiple tables in a relational database

New words
field – a single bit of
Information about a person
or an item, for example, age
record – a group of related
fields about an item or
person that is captured in
the table
Primary key – a field that
holds a unique identifier for
each record in the
database (Unique means
there is only one of its kind)

Each table consists of fields and records. Fields are the categories that you
want to record data for. For example, the music table shown above, contains
fields like Title, Artist, Duration and Album. Records refer to the actual data being
captured, with each record containing the data of a single item. For example, in
the Song table, each record represents a single song, with all the information (like
artist and duration) related to that song.
Each table may have one compulsory field, called a primary key, which contains
a unique identifier for each record in the database. This allows you to refer to a
specific record on a table in such a way that it could only refer to one entry. While
it is possible to make an existing field of a table a key field, database creators
usually create a new field specifically for this purpose. This allows them to make
sure that there are no duplicates.
Sometimes there are anomalies with databases, you will learn how to get rid of
these anomalies.
In this chapter, you will design and create a relational database. Sometimes there
are anomalies with databases, you will learn how to get rid of these and reach
normalisation.

DATABASES IN A NUTSHELL
Data, in principal, is stored in 1s and 0s. The computer still needs to know how
these 1s and 0s are organised and how they should be interpreted. In order to do
this, computers make use of data structures that describe a specific sequence
for data to be organised. This allows the computer to understand how the
different bits of data are related and to interpret the data correctly.

24

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

We know that each letter in the alphabet represents a character. When you add
enough characters together, they form a word (like ‘orange’ or ‘love’) that
represents a concept. Therefore, allowing communication of useful information
between two or more people – even across distances.
In order to communicate data and instructions, data such as numbers, letters,
characters, special symbol, sounds/phonics, and images are converted into
computer-readable form (binary). Once the processing of this data is complete it
is converted into human-readable format, the processed data becomes
meaningful information. The information becomes knowledge and can be
understood and used by humans for different purposes.

Characteristics of a good database

2.1

All good databases should begin with valuable metadata and data. In Chapter 1 we looked at the
characteristics of valuable data and how to manage that data. These are illustrated in Figure 2.3 below:

The Infoneering Model

Information
capture data and knowledge

Data
facts

Knowledge

Decisions

our map of the world

informed actions

Figure 2.3: How to manage valuable database
Let’s now look at the characteristics of a good database:
●●
The database should be strong enough to store all the relevant data and requirements.
●●
Should be able to relate the tables in the database by means of a relation, for example, an employee
works for a department so that employee is related to a particular department. We should be able to
define such a relationship between any two entities in the database.
●●
Multiple users should be able to access the same database, without affecting the other user. For
example, several teachers can work on a database to update learners’ marks at the same time.
Teachers should also be allowed to update the marks for their subjects, without modifying other
subject marks.
●●
A single database provides different views to different users, it supports multiple views to the user,
depending on his role. In a school database, for example, teachers can see the breakdown of
learners’ marks; however, parents are only able to see only their child’s report – thus the parents’
access would be read only. At the same time, teachers will have access to all the learners’ information
and assessment details with modification rights. All this is able to happen in the same database.
●●
Data integrity refers to how accurate and consistent the data in a database is. Databases with lots
ofmissing information and incorrect information is said to have low data integrity.
●●
Data independence refers to the separation between data and the application (or applications) in
whichit is being used. This allows you to update the data in your application (such as fixing a spelling
mistake)without having to recompile the entire application.
●●
Data Redundancy refers to having the exact same data at different places in the database. Data
redundancy Increases the size of the database, creates Integrity problems, decreases efficiency and
leads to anomalies. Data should be stored so that It Is not repeated In multiple tables.
●●
Data security refers to how well the data in the database is protected from crashes, hacks
andaccidental deletion.
●●
Data maintenance refers to monthly, daily or hourly tasks that are run to fix errors within a
databaseand prevent anomalies from occurring. Database maintenance not only fixes errors, but it
also detects potential errors and prevents future errors from occurring.

26

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

There are also many people involved with organising a well-run database. These are:
●●
the developers, who design and develop the database to suite the needs of an enterprise
●●
the administrator, who:
●●
checks the database for its usages
●●
who is checking it
●●
provides access to other uses
●●
provides any other maintenance work required to keep the database up to date
●●
the end user, who uses the database, for example, teachers or parents.

Problems with Databases

2.2

If a flat-file database is poorly planned, denormalised and inconsistent, it will create problems when trying
to insert, delete or modify the records (tables) in the database. This causes anomalies, which make
handling the data increasingly difficult as the database grows. It also makes the data integrity harder to
maintain. Trying to make the data consistent once an anomaly occurs can become quite difficult.
There are three types of problems that can occur in databases:
●●
Insertion anomaly: The database has been created in such a way that required data cannot be
added unless another piece of unavailable data is also added. For example, a hospital database that
cannot store the details of a new member until that member has been seen by a doctor.
●●
Deletion anomaly: The legitimate deletion of a record of data can cause the deletion of some
required data. For example, deleting some of the patient’s details can remove all the details of the
patient from the hospital database.
●●
Modification anomaly: Incorrect data may have to be changed, which could involve many records
having to be changed, leading to the possibility of some changes being made incorrectly.

Example 2.1

Problems that occur in a database

For example, look at the below schema that represents information related to a school:

Problems:
●●
Data redundancy: Data redundancy refers to storing the exact same data at different places in a database.
Data redundancy increases the size of your database, creates integrity problems, decreases the efficiency of the
database and can lead to database anomalies. Data should be stored in such a way that it should not be
repeated in multiple tables. The family can be represented as one unit.
●●
Update anomaly: Data will be inconsistent if one entity is updated, for example, if the family address changes,
the data capturer will need to change all four entities.
●●
Unable to represent some information: the school cannot keep information about learners who are on the
waiting list as they do not have an account with the school.
●●
Deletion anomaly: closure of the account for one child will remove all data of the second child from the database.

2.3

How to get rid of Anomalies

To prevent anomalies you need to normalise the database by efficiently organising the data in a database.
According to Edgar F Codd, the inventor of relational databases, the goals of normalisation include:
●●
removing all redundant (or repeated) data from the database
●●
removing undesirable insertions, updates and deletion dependencies
●●
reducing the need to restructure the entire database every time new fields are added to it
●●
making the relationships between tables more useful and understandable.
Normalisation is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and Insertion,
Modification and Deletion Anomalies. The database designer structures the data in a way that eliminates
unnecessary duplication(s) and provides a rapid search path to all necessary information. It is a multi-step
process that puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables. This process
of specifying and defining tables, keys, columns, and relationships in order to create an efficient database
is called normalisation.
Normalisation will reduce the amount of space a database uses and ensure that data is efficiently stored.
Without normalisation, database systems can be inaccurate, slow, and inefficient. They might not produce
the data that you expect.
In practice this means changing your database so that the following requirements are met:
●●
each table must have a primary key
●●
each record should have single valued attributes/columns (atomic)
●●
there should be no repeating groups of information.
Keys are used to establish and identify relationships between tables and also to uniquely identify any
record or row of data inside a table. A key can be a single attribute or a group of attributes (compositeprimary key), where the combination may act as a key. Keys help us to identify any row of data.
When designing a database, the four types of key fields are:
●●
Primary key: the field selected by the database creator to uniquely identify each record on a table.
For example, each song in your music database might have a primary key field called “song_id”.
●●
Alternative key: a field containing unique values that could be used as the primary key but is not
currently set as the primary key, for example, artist_id.
●●
Foreign key: a field containing values from a different table’s primary key field. Foreign keys are used
to show the relationship between different tables. For example, each song in your music database
might have a foreign key field called “artist_id” that links the song to a specific artist on an “artists”
table.
●●
Composite key: a combination of more than one field that uniquely identifies each record on a table,
for example, song_id and artist_id.
Let’s use this example to understand the four main types of keys:

SONG_ID

ARTIST_ID

TYPE OF MUSIC

Normalisation rules are divided into the following normal forms:

FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF)
For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following four rules:
●●
Each column must have a separate field/attribute. Each column of your table should not contain
multiple values. For example, imagine the database for Facebook status updates, specifically the
table related to likes. For the records to be indivisible, each like should be stored in a separate
record. In this way, each record would either have occurred or not occurred. There is no way to say
that only a small part of the like occurred, while a different part did not. However, if all the likes for a
status update are stored in a single record, then the record would be divisible, since it would be
possible for some of the likes to have occurred while others did not occur.
●●
Values stored in a column should be of the same kind or type (domain). In each column the
values stored must be of the same kind or type.
●●
All the columns in a table should have unique names. Each column in a table should have a
unique name to avoid confusion at the time of retrieving data or performing any other operation on
the stored data. For example, specify Child’s name and parent’s name, don’t use ‘Name’.
●●
The order in which data is stored, does not matter. For example

●●

ACCOUNTNO

NAME

SUBJECT

542

Tafadzwa

Eng, Maths

543

Sipho

Science, ICT

544

Gift

ICT, Maths

545

Naledi

English, Science

The table complies to three rules out of the four rules: the column names are unique, the data stored
is in the correct order and there are no inter-mixed different types of data in the columns. However,
the learners in the table have opted for more than one subject. This data has been stored in the
subject names in a single column. As per the 1NF, each column must contain a single value.

SECOND NORMAL FORM (2NF)
For a table to be in the Second Normal Form:
●●
it should be in the First Normal Form.
●●
and it should not have Partial Dependency.
This is where an attribute in a table depends on only a part of the primary key and not on the whole key.
For example, a table records the primary keys as student_id and the subject_id of each learner. Only the
teacher’s name depends on subject. So, the subject_id, and has nothing to do with student_id.

THIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF)
A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when:
●●
it is in the Second Normal Form.
●●
it does not have Transitive Dependency. Transitive Dependency occurs when an attribute/field
depends on other attributes/fields rather than depending on the primary key.
This is an indirect relationship between values in the same table.

INTRODUCTION
A large reason for this trend towards mobile computing is that mobile computers
provide you with most of the advantages of computers wherever you go.
Computer users no longer need to sit in one place to use a computer or a fixed
internet line to connect to the internet. Instead, any question you have, message
you need to send, video you want to watch or song you want to listen to, is now
available to you wherever you go – if you have a smartphone.
Most of the tasks smartphones are not suited to do (sending long emails, creating
documents etc.), notebooks can do exceptionally well. It Is only in specialist
areas like programming, video editing and gaming that desktop computers are
prefferred. As a result, many desktop computers are sold to power users and
gamers, while average computer users prefer moble computers.
In this chapter you will learn about the advantages and disadvantages of mobile
computing and how to troubleshoot hardware problems. You will also learn more
about choosing hardware components and designing an appropriate computer
for different situations.

HARDWARE IN A NUTSHELL
You have learnt about the different hardware devices, their functions and capabilities. Here is a recap of
these:
●●
An input device allows the user to interact directly with a computer. An input device allows the user
to interact directly with a computer. Common input devices include the following: keyboards,
pointing devices (mouse), touch-sensitive pads, pen input, video input, scanners, capturing devices,
data collection devices, biometric input, and card readers.
●●
An input/output device is any hardware used by a human operator or other systems to communicate
with a computer. They are capable of sending data (output) to a computer and receiving data from a
computer (input). Common input/output devices include: touch screens, game controllers, digital
cameras, smart phones, smartboards, toy/electronic device interfaces.
●●
An output device is any device that takes data stored on a computer and makes it available to the
user in an easy to understand way. This data may be made available using pictures (such as on a
monitor or printed to a page) or using sounds (such as with speakers and earphones). the output
devices can be divided into the following: display devices – monitors (LCD, LED), and printers (inkjet,
ink tank, laser, 3-D).
●●
Storage devices all serve the same general purpose: to store data. because of the differences in
storage capacity, portability and speed, different storage devices are generally used for different
reasons. Types of storage devices: hard disk drive (HDD), external (portable) hard drives, solid-state
drive, hybrid storage device, flash drives (disks), SD/memory cards, cd, dvd and blu-ray drives.
●●
Processing devices are the computer devices responsible for carrying out instructions and
performing calculations. Processing devices include: central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics
processing unit (GPU).

UNIT

3.1

Mobile technologies

In ICT, mobile technologies refer to computing devices like smartphones, laptops and tablets. These are
small, but powerful, devices that are easy to carry around. This unit will look briefly at the advantages of
mobile computers, before looking at the constraints faced by mobile computer creators.

UNDERSTANDING SMARTPHONES
Small, mobile computers and smartphones have most of the same hardware as desktop computers. As
such, it is important to understand how smartphone components compare with those of desktop
computers. In general:
●●
A smartphone features an onscreen-touch keyboard that is much smaller than that of a standard
computer. The keyboard and mouse of a standard computer is prefferred becausee of the
comfortable sizing.
●●
Smartphones screens are touch screens that are smaller than desktop screens.
●●
Standard computers generally can be fitted with more RAM and faster processsors, making them
better suited to tasks that require significant processing power.
●●
Smartphones come standard with communication devices like bluetooth and wifi, making them
better at connecting to the internet via the numerous hotspots anywhere in the world.
This means that desktop computers are more powerful and are better suited for serious computing tasks,
whether it is a processor intensive task such as encoding videos or inputting large amounts of data.
However, high-end smartphones are small, easy to carry around and better suited than computers at
many tasks requiring a very mobile computer. This includes tasks like reading messages and emails,
setting reminders, checking the weather, updating social media accounts, making bank payments, doing
Google searches and making voice and video calls.
Smartphones and tablets are also better at location-based computing, which refers to software that
changes the application based on a user’s location. As you have learned in Chapter 1, examples of
location-based computing include weather applications, food ordering applications, car sharing services,
dating applications and augmented reality (AR) applications.
All these technologies use a combination of GPS and mobile internet connections to improve the service
they offer you. Many of these location-based services are unique to mobile computers.

ADVANTAGES OF MOBILITY
When compared to desktop computers, mobile computers have several significant advantages. Amongst
these advantages is:
●●
size and weight: due to these devices being small and light weight, they are easy to carry around,
easy to keep on hand, can be used in any location and are comfortable to use without a desk.
As smartphones, tablets and notebooks have become more powerful, the number of uses that desktop

tasks that mobile computers are significantly better at continues to increase.

MOBILE CONSTRAINTS
Mobile computing constraints refers to the disadvantages of smart phones,
laptops and tablets caused through battery life and computing power versus
power consumption.
Let’s work through each constraint in order to understand how these constraints
affect mobile computers.

BATTERY LIFE
The processing power of a CPU is closely linked to the amount of electricity
available to it. The more power your CPU uses; the more instructions it can
complete. The problem for smartphones and tablets is that they have a limited
amount of power stored in the battery, and this power generally needs to last the
whole day.

Figure 3.1: Smartphone batteries are designed to last at least one day on a single charge

COMPUTING POWER VS POWER CONSUMPTION
Because of the small size of mobile devices (especially smartphones
and tablets), all smartphone components need to be miniaturised. The
physical size of a smartphone or tablet CPU is almost the same as the
physical size of a desktop CPU. However, unlike desktop CPUs, these
chips contain many components, including a CPU, GPU, LTE modem,
Wi-Fi connector, RAM, Bluetooth connector and GPS tracker. In a
desktop, each of these components are separate – this means that
each item can be more powerful.

Figure 3.2: Smartphone do not show
large amounts of data well

36

Even the biggest smartphone monitor is tiny compared to a desktop
monitor and can only display a limited amount of information. This
makes it unsuitable to use applications that require a large amount of
information to be shown (such as spreadsheets or word processing).
●●
While this works well when it is in a user’s hands, it makes it
difficult to use with a physical mouse and keyboard.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

The last element we will explore is the size of the keyboard. While a smartphone
or tablet keyboard is well suited to sending quick messages or occasionally
typing an email, they are not well suited to entering large amounts of text
Taken together, these functions make smartphones and tablets less suitable for
tasks requiring a lot of processing power or user input.

Did you know
A high-end gaming PC
uses more power in one
day than a high-end
smartphone uses in a year!

Because of this, smartphones simply cannot run the same CPU-intensive
programs as computers. Even if they could somehow get rid of all the heat this
would generate, their battery would go flat in a few minutes.

Case Study

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 heat problems

In 2016, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was one of the fastest and most expensive
smartphones of the year. However, a few weeks after the phone launched, Samsung
received thousands of complaints that the phone was heating up to dangerous levels and
were forced to recall and refund the owners of more than 2 000 000 Galaxy Note 7s.

Figure 3.3: Many organisations banned people from travelling with Galaxy Note 7’s
Two months after being released, Samsung issued a full recall on all Samsung Galaxy
Note 7s and stopped all production of the phone. After testing more than 200 000
phones, Samsung announced that the problem was with the lack of space between the
CPU and the battery. As a result, the connectors inside the battery warped from the
heat, which caused some of them to short circuit and catch fire.

3.2

Factors influencing performance of a computer

Having looked at some of the differences between mobile technologies and traditional desktop computers,
it is useful to see exactly how the different computer components influence the performance of a computer
or smartphone.
There are two factors that have a direct effect on your CPU’s (and therefore, your computer’s) performance:
The speed of the CPU and the ability of the CPU to run multiple processes.
The speed of the CPU is a direct measurement of how many instructions it can complete per second. The
more instructions it can complete, the faster the CPU and your applications run. This is closely linked to
the CPU’s clock speed (given in MHz or GHz), which indicates how frequently it will complete an instruction
per second.
The second factor is the ability of the CPU to do multiprocessing. Multiprocessing allows a computer to
complete tasks from multiple applications at the same time. A CPU that is good at multiprocessing might
be able to complete the instructions from hundreds of processes at the same time. A CPU that is not as
good at multiprocessing might start stuttering if it tries to run too many processes at once.
A slow GPU will not affect your computer’s performance on normal applications (like creating a document
or browsing the web), but it will have a big effect on the performance of graphic-intensive tasks, such as
playing games or creating videos.
The two main factors that affect the GPU’s performance are:
●●
GPU clock speed (MHz) – the higher the clock speed, the more instructions the GPU can process
●●
the type of GPU.

MEMORY CAPACITY
RAM
When the RAM capacity is too small, using the computer will become much slower as information needs
to constantly be added to and removed from RAM. This will be especially noticeable when switching
between two open applications since the computer would need to remove all the previously open
application’s data from memory and replace it with the new application’s data. When this problem becomes
serious enough, your computer might automatically close some applications to free up memory.

Figure 3.4: A computer might close applications or web pages if it runs out of RAM

term 2 I Chapter 3 Hardware I Unit 3.2 Factors influencing performance of a computer

39

CPU CACHE
Another form of memory is caching. Caching refers to a small, temporary form of
storage that is created so that the data stored in the cache can be accessed more
quickly. There are three important forms of caching:
●●
CPU cache: Due to the growing difference in speed between a computer’s
CPU and RAM, many CPUs now have a small, high-speed cache built into
the CPU where it can temporarily store the data it needs. The speed and size
of the CPU cache can have a significant impact on a CPU’s performance.
●●
Disk cache: The disk cache is a small amount of RAM that is built into a
hard disk drive. It stores data being sent or received by the hard disk plates
for a short period of time.
●●
Web cache: The web cache is a small area on a computer’s hard drive
where images and pages from the world wide web are stored for a short
period of time. This allows users to quickly load those images from their
computers, rather than over a slow internet connection, when they open a
page that they have previously viewed.

STORAGE

New words
seek time – the time taken
for a disk drive to locate the
area on the disk where the
data to be read is stored.
rotational latency – also
called rotational delay, is the
amount of time it takes for
the desired sector of
a disk (i.e., the sector from
which data is to be read
or written) to rotate under
the read-write heads of
the disk drive)

Secondary Storage (also called external memory or auxilliary storage) is not
directly acessible to the CPU. The computer uses Its Input/output channels to
access secondary storage and transfer the desired data to primary storage. Hard
Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) are used as secondary
storage. Other examples of secondary storage technologies include USB flash
drives, Compact Disks(CDs), Digital Video disks(DVDs) external hard disk drives.

SPEED
The access time per byte for HDDs or SSDs is typically measured
in milliseconds (one thousandth seconds), while the access time per byte for
primary storage is measured in nanoseconds (one billionth seconds). Thus,
secondary storage is significantly slower than primary storage. Rotating optical
storage devices, such as CD and DVD drives, have even longer access times.
Once the disk read/write head on HDDs reaches the proper placement and the
data, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek
time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large
contiguous blocks.

DISK CACHING
The disk cache is a small amount of RAM that is built into a hard disk drive. It
stores data being sent or received by the hard disk plates for a short period of
time and if the same data is required then it is taken from the disk cache improving
the time it takes to read from or write to a hard disk. It is usually included as part
of the hard disk or a specified portion of random access memory (RAM).

40

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)
The NIC provides the hardware interface between a computer and a network and
enables a device to network with other devices. It can either be in the form of an
add-in card that fits in an expansion slot on a computer’s motherboard to expand
the functionality of the system or is usually built-in and is a part of the circuit board.
The standard wired NIC is measured by its speed in Mbps (Megabits per second):
10 Mbps is too slow, 100 Mbps is faster, and 1000 Mbps (1 gigabit) is the fastest.
The speed of the NIC can affect perfermance when it comes to:
●●
loading webpages or web applications
●●
downloading applications or games from the internet
●●
downloading program updates from the internet
●●
copying large amounts of data over the network
●●
watching multimedia over the network.

Motivate a typical computer system in respect of
user requirements

By using top-of-the-line hardwrae components, you could build a computer able to play the latest games
with ultra-quality graphics and 4K resolution, encode videos in a fraction of the time of normal computers,
and complete any daily computing task while only using a small percentage of the power available!
In this unit, you will learn more about different hardware configurations. You will learn what range of
hardware to select for a specific type of user, how to compare and select between two different types of
hardware, and finally, how to identify the hardware configuration already installed in a computer.

SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE CONFIGURATION
This section will look at typical computer setups for the following types of users:
●●
Home user
●●
Small office user
●●
Gamer
●●
Power user
For each user, you will learn to identify what they are most likely to use the computer for, what components
are important for their use and why certain components should be selected.

HOME USER
The average home user mostly uses a computer for:
●●
browsing the internet
●●
posting on social networks
●●
sending email
●●
doing word processing
●●
watching online and local videos
●●
listening to music.
However, categorising someone as an ‘average’ home user has become a lot harder than it used to be.

SMALL OFFICE USER
The average business user uses a computer for:
●●
online research
●●
sending emails and business communication
●●
using word processing and spreadsheet applications
●●
note taking.
None of these tasks require a very powerful computer. However, there are four factors that are particularly
important to business users:
●●
Mobility, which allows them to take their computers to meetings or home.
●●
Battery life, which allows them to use their computers for extended periods of time without access
to a power source.
●●
Screen resolution, which allows them to view more information on a screen at a time.
●●
Speed, since business users are usually paid for the work they deliver, the computer should never
decrease their productivity.

44

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

GAMER
Modern games are designed to take advantage of the incredible processing power of CPUs and GPUs.
As a result, they are one of the most processing-intensive tasks completed on personal computers.
Gaming is such a good measure of a computer’s processing power, that games are often used to
benchmark computer hardware and see how well certain types of hardware perform.
This does not, however, mean that all gaming computers must be expensive. There are three options for
gaming PCs:
●●
entry level
●●
mid-range
●●
high-end
The biggest difference between an entry-level gaming computer and a mid-range gaming computer is the
graphics card.High-end gaming computers will be able to play all games at high or very high quality, while
the most expensive of these computers will be able to play games at ultra-high quality at very high resolutions.
With gaming computers, it is incredibly important that you build a balanced setup where all the components
are roughly the same speed. Having a CPU that is much faster than your GPU will not help your computer,
since the quality of you game will be limited by the speed of your GPU. The same is true if you have too
little or too slow RAM.

POWER USERS
The term power user is a general term that refers to people who use their computers to do advanced
tasks. Examples of power users include computer programmers, web developers, video editors and
graphic designers.
In general, these tasks do not require computers more powerful than those of gaming computers, although
processing speed and RAM are especially important for power users, as it allow these users to run more
applications at the same time and complete processing-intensive tasks (such as video encoding or
compiling a program) more quickly. Power users may also require more storage space on their computers
and usually use at least two monitors for their work.

SELECTING THE HARDWARE
Now that you have a basic idea of the types of computers to purchase for different
users, you can look at specific components to use for different configurations.
The table below suggests hardware configuration for different types of computers.

Internet of Things (IoT) and their Impact on society

INTRODUCTION
Mobile Technology has radically changed our personal and social lives and how
the business world works. Although these changes have mostly been positive
(social networking, navigation, and so on), the security of our personal information
is at great risk.

4.1

Mobile technology

In Chapter 3 we learned that a mobile device is any type of handheld computer, for example, tablets,
e-readers, global positioning system (GPS) devices, wireless debit/credit card payment terminals and
smartphones. These devices are portable, fit in your hand and are powerful enough to do many of the
same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer.
Internet privacy (also called online privacy) is the right of personal privacy in regards to the rearranging,
storing, provision to third parties, and display of information relating to you via the internet. In general, the
right to be free from secret surveillance and to determine whether, when, how, and to whom, one’s
personal or organizational information is to be revealed.

IMPACT OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY
ADVANTAGES
INSTANT COMMUNICATION
Family and friends have easy access to SMS, text messaging, call, video chat, and apps that allow them
to instantly communicate with everyone across the globe. Smartphone cameras allow this ‘selfie’
generation to constantly post pictures of themselves, business related pictures, holiday videos and
business related videos etc. via social media.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION
These devices are integrated with mobile browsers that enable them to access websites anytime and
anywhere. A large amount of the total time spent by people on smartphones is used in opening browsers
to surf the internet. With easy access to helpful content, learners can have interactive learning through
watching education videos, playing education applications and researching topics.

ENTERTAINMENT
Mobile technology (especially smartphones) provides a source of entertainment. Users can listen to their
favorite music, play games, gamble on-line, watch movies and read e-books among other things.

SAVING TIME – INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
Smartphones can do almost everything with the help of apps. Both individuals and businesses benefit
from the use of apps like: photo and video editor, ticket booking, online store, payment system, data
analysis, personal assistant, and so on. These services are not restricted to business hours. With Global
Positioning System (GPS), people can locate certain addresses and areas all around the world which has
helped both individuals and business with communication and especially transportation.

PRIVACY
You can do whatever you want without anyone knowing it via a smartphone. You can snap photos of
yourself and secure your photo library with a password. You can also send messages to your loved ones
without the fear of anyone knowing it. Online transactions can also be done through smartphones.

DISADVANTAGES
COST
Smartphones can be expensive, especially high-end phones with great specs and features. This added
cost has a negative impact on a family’s and businesses financial budget.

54

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

POOR SOCIAL INTERACTION
‘Real’ social interaction degrades. People no longer interact with people outside since they spend more
time with their smartphones.

DISTRACTION
Smartphones can be distracting. Applications notify you when there are messages, updates, latest
offerings, etc. These interrupt the momentum and can affect your productivity.

HEALTH
Mobile devices (like smartphones) emit radiofrequency energy which can be absorbed by the tissues in
the body. Sleep deprivation, damage to your eyes etc. are some of the health issues associated with the
use of smartphones. Addiction to games, social media, and so on, also impacts negatively on your health.

EXTRA WORK
Smartphones are widely used in business. Various apps allow you to work on extra workloads which were
not even existent before. Your boss can instantly call you even in the middle of the night.

UNCENSORED CONTENT
With easy access to information and the internet, people, especially children can see uncensored content
including violence, pornographic content, fake news, and so on.

IMPACT ON PRIVACY
Your smartphone interrupts you with texts, WhatsApp messages, tweets, e-mails, Facebook alerts, and
so on. You are being overloaded by social networking Information on a daily basis. This flood of messages
and alerts, distracts you to an extent that productivity and efficiency suffers. All networking tools, sites and
apps encourage you to share information, but you are not told of the possible negative consequences.
You are also unaware of how your information and uploads will be shared. Search engines are built into
various social networking tools and apps and privacy settings are defaulted to ‘maximum sharing and
visibility’. These settings allow search engines to access data that you have not restricted. Even if you
keep your data private, a search engine can still access your networking profile. Anything you say or do in
a group environment is immediately public and vulnerable in terms of being shared. Some social engineers
can be con artists who pretend to be what they are not in order to benefit themselves (gain access to
information, money, and so on). The availability of personal information on social networking sites makes
the jobs of social engineers much easier and hence identity theft (stealing and using another persons
identity to fraudulently open accounts) is becoming increasingly prevalent.
Although smartphones are made private, there is still security risks and threats everywhere. Hackers are
always present and virtual viruses are potent. Smartphones are vulnerable to these threats when you
access the internet.
Several other institutions give internet users cause to worry about their personal or corporate privacy online.
Government and law enforcement agencies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), public search engines, and
social media gain access to our private data as we interact with them online – and many of them gain from
gathering and distributing this information more widely. This might be for political, investigative purposes,
as leverage in facilitating criminal activities or as a profit-making tool in sales to third parties.
Mobite technology users often aren’t even aware that by making an online transaction, they may in effect
be selling data about themselves to not only the parent company or website they’re dealing with, but their
affiliates and supply chain partners, as well. The ease of connecting mobile devices to public free wifi
hotspots and always-on networks has compromised personal and corporate privacy online.

IoT – Technologies enabling the IoT and their
impact on society

The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of all the web-enabled devices that collect, send and act on data they
acquire from their surrounding environments using embedded sensors, processors and communication
hardware. IoT refers to the billions of devices around the world that are connected to the internet through
sensors or Wi-Fi.

TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE IOT
The recent convergence of three technological trends has made the IoT possible:
●●
Increasing processing power of embedded platforms: due to the smaller sizes, reduce in cost
and reduce in power consumption, general purpose CPU’s have gradually replaced microcontrollers
in devices. The transition to CPUs is critical because CPUs can run operating systems that support
networking and popular programming languages.
●●
Development of smaller OSs and protocol: as the performance of embedded platforms rose,
lightweight versions of mainstream operating systems like Windows and Linux displaced embedded
operating systems and brought their massive software ecosystems, and large pool of developers,
with them.
●●
Development of wireless communications: Wi-Fi has gotten faster with each new addition to the
802.11 class of protocols. The connectivity options for low-power devices have also been expanding
in the industrial and consumer electronics markets.Impact on society
There are many ways that IoT will affect and benefit society, below are a few examples:
●●
Waste management: sensors in a fridge will record anything that is not used so that you can
examine the trends and patterns. The less waste the less pollution. Sensors in bins can record the
trends and patterns of what can be recycled.
●●
Daily commute: Sensors will let you know the shortest route to your work or home; which routes
would be the most economical on petrol and if you can rather take public transport. Taxi services for
business meetings can be planned according to your calendar and synced with your smartphone.
●●
Smart cities: These can include fast and convenient transportation systems, street lighting that
switches on or off depending on the amount of natural light and energy-efficient buildings. For
example, Barcelona has a citywide WiFi and information network linked to sensors, software and a
data analytics platform. This provides the city with smart water technology, automated street lighting,
remote-controlled irrigation for parks and fountains, “on-demand” waste pickups, digital bus routes
and smart parking meters. This has reduced traffic jams and pollution, as well as water, light and
energy usage.
●●
Agriculture: Sensors can track microclimates across farms, to monitor temperature changes and
humidity levels as perishable goods move from field to warehouse to store. This can extend their
shelf life and eliminate waste.
●●
Businesses: IoT is used to detect and troubleshoot remote issues, predict maintenance needs,
track production line efficiency, monitor devices etc. These directly impact a company’s revenue.
●●
Smart water sensors: These sensors monitor the water quality, temperature, pressure, and usage.
This data is used by the water company to analyse how customers are using water and to help them
be more efficient. Water leak detectors are used to find tiny leaks that can lead to huge water waste.

your answers. Each group presents their findings to the class.
4.2.2 Read the following article on the top five predictions of IoT in 2019.

5 Internet Of Things Trends
Everyone Should Know About
By BERNARD MARR
Johannesburg, 15 Feb 2018
2019 will see the Internet of Things
(IoT) becoming more deeply embedded
in our day-to-day lives at home and at
work. We may begin to hear the term
itself used less frequently – but that’s
because it’s moving out of the hype
phase and quickly becoming a part of
everyday life.
Soon, it will be taken for granted
that pretty much any device we
own – cars, TVs, watches, kitchen
appliances can go online and
communicate with each other. In
industry too, tools and machinery are
increasingly intelligent and connected,
generating data that drives efficiency
and enables new paradigms such as
predictive maintenance to become a
reality, rather than a pipe-dream. In
fact, it is predicted that by the end of
2019 there will be 26 billion connected
devices around the world.
Here are five predictions about how
this is likely to play out over the next
12 months as we become increasingly
used to the fact that the internet isn’t
just something we connect to using
computers and smartphones, but
virtually anything we can think of:
Businesses will get serious
about IoT: According to research by
Forrester, businesses will lead the
surge in IoT adoption in 2019, with
85% of companies implementing or
planning IoT deployments this year.

58

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

IoT clearly offers huge benefits
to businesses: Some examples we
have seen in recent years include
mannequins that can communicate
with customers’ smartphones in retail
environments, beaming information
about products on display.
Manufacturing, however, is the clear
leader when it comes to IoT
deployment. Here, throughout 2019,
businesses will increasingly see the
value in connected machinery that is
capable of reporting every detail of its
operating parameters and efficiency to
other smart, connected devices.
Predictive maintenance is
something that has been promised for
a while by tech evangelists but is
currently only achieved by the biggest
players who have invested heavily in
IoT for several years now.
With a growing understanding of
when these solutions are (or aren’t)
useful, these solutions will start to
trickle down to smaller organizations,
that can be confident that their
investments will pay off.

Factors influencing computer management

Learning outcomes
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
●●
discusscomputer management issues.
●●
recommend management tasks for general housekeeping, maintaining data integrity
and protecting the system

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter you will learn about several different computer management tasks.
These tasks include clearing up storage space, updating software, and increasing
the capability of your computer by installing new software and hardware. You will
also learn how to change the key settings of your computer.

COMPUTER MANAGEMENT IN A NUTSHELL
Computer management is a process of managing, monitoring and optimising
your computer’s functionality to best serve your needs. This process could
include improving and maintaining the security features, performance, and
reliability of your computer.
The key tasks that you can do to ensure your computer remains fast, reliable and
secure include the following:
●●
managing your desktop
●●
managing files and folders by:
{{ freeing up storage space
{{ compressing files and folders
{{ updating your software
{{ backing up your files
{{ scanning for viruses and malware
{{ checking your hard disks.
Remember that to keep your computer running effectively, you need to ensure
that you have enough free storage space available. If not, you might not be able
to create new files or install new programs.

term 2 I Chapter 5 Computer management

61

The majority of programs also automatically create temporary files and folders when you run them. Without
enough free space, these programs cannot create the temporary files they need, and this will cause the
files to crash or display error messages. The operating system uses some of your hard drive space as
virtual memory. This will allow the operating system to operate more smoothly – so without any free space,
your computer will slow down noticeably.

UNIT

5.1

Factors influencing computer management

A computer’s speed, ease of use and security are influenced by various factors.
The five most important factors are:
●●
software
●●
security
●●
housekeeping
●●
amount of unused space on the hard drive
●●
errors and corrupt files

SOFTWARE
Software refers to computer Instructions in the form of operating systems, utilities,
programs, and applications that enable computers to work.
Software affects a computer’s performance in different ways:
●●
installing too many applications may use up a computer’s resources and
cause the computer to slow down,
●●
out-of-date software may contain bugs or security problems
●●
viruses are also a form of software and are often installed with other
software applications.
The most important software task you should complete is to regularly update
your software. (An update is new, improved, or fixed software, which replaces
older versions of the same software.)
Most applications follow one of three update strategies. They:
●●
Ask you to allow them to update automatically: Whenever your computer asks
to update a program, allow it to update as soon as possible. If it is not
possible to install the update immediately,
schedule a suitable time to install the
update.
●●
The application informs you that an update
is available and links you to the update
location.
●●
This will update the program to the newest
version without changing your settings.
●●
The applcation can reates patches but
does not inform you. If this occurs, then
search the internet once or twice a year to
see if a new version has been released. If it
has, download this version and install it to
Figure 5.1: Microsoft Windows automatically installs updates
update your software.
Today, most computer programmers continue to release patches and updates to
their software after the software is released. Software patches and updates
generally repair security holes, fix or remove computer bugs and add new features
and improve existing ones.

SECURITY
Computer security is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized
use. Closely linked to a computer’s software is the security of the computer. As you learned in Grade 10
and 11, weak security can result in files being accessed illegally, and viruses being installed leading to
reduced computer performance. As such, a computer’s security must be managed.
When it comes to computer security, there are two main goals: Prevent any malicious software from
affecting your computer by using antivirus software, and backup your files so that they are safe, even if
your computer is damaged in some way.
In this section, you will look at these tasks:
Firewall: A firewall is a network utility that prevents unauthorised network connections to and from your
computer. This means that only the applications you allow on your computing device can send or receive
data from and to the internet.
Antivirus: An Antivirus is a software programme that is designed to prevent, search, detect and remove
malicious software (Malware) from your computing device.Spyware: Spyware is a piece of code that hides
on your computer and tracks all your activity without your knowledge. You can control the Spyware, by
activating the pop-up blocker on your browser settings or by installing an anti-spyware software application.
Adware: Adware is a type of malware that presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer
in the form of pop-up or an ‘unclosable window’.

BACK UP DATA
Data backup is a process of duplicating data and storing it in an alternative location to allow retrieval of the
duplicate set after a data loss event (natural disaster, theft situation, accidental deletion).
Data loss can occur due to:
●●
hardware failure
●●
many potential threats to your data (like viruses and Trojans don’t just steal your data. In some
cases, they erase it)
●●
the threat of ransomware (when a hacker puts a virus on your computer that encrypts your data,
making it useless).
Backing your data up is the single best way to protect your data. With an up to date backup, any data that
you lose can be recovered easily.
To make sure your backup is effective, you should use the following guidelines when creating a backup
system. The backup:
●●
must include all important files and folders.
●●
should be run regularly, preferably every day, but at least once a week.
●●
must be saved on a different storage device from the data it is backing up.
●●
should be saved on a storage device that is not permanently connected to your computer.
●●
should be kept in a safe place to protect it from physical damage.
●●
data should be verified occasionally to make sure the backup system is still working.

64

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

There are three main techniques you can use to create a backup:
●●
Copy and paste (select files and folders you would like to backup, copy them using the copy
command and paste In a folder on an external hard drive),
●●
Backup and Restore Software: (This utility can be used to automatically backup your data to an
external hard drive by simply updating changes to the relevant files that were backed-up previously).
and
●●
Online backup (back files up online using a service like Google Drive).

HOUSEKEEPING
This refers to the way in which a computer and its files and folders are organised so that they are quick
and easy to find. General housekeeping tasks include:

DISK CLEAN-UP
Disk clean-up is a computer maintenance utility designed to free-up storage space on a computing
device. It identifies and removes temporary files that are no longer needed and cleans out old files,
programs and settings that cause your computer to slow down. Defragmentation of the hard disk also
improves the speed at which the files are accessed.

SCHEDULING AND UPDATING
You can use a task scheduler to create and manage common tasks that your computer will carry out
automatically at a time you specify, for example, you can schedule your computer to run a software
update or make a backup at a specific time.

ARCHIVE AND BACKING-UP
Archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for
long-term retention. These files are, however, not duplicated. Archived data consists of old data that
remains important and is retained for future reference.
A back-up is the process of making copies/duplicates of data and storing it on a different device in a
different geographical location in the event of the original data being lost or destroyed.

COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION
File compression refers to the process that makes use of advanced algorithms and mathematical formulas
to decrease the amount of disc space used by big files. Decompressing a file is the method of extracting
the compressed file back to its original form using the same algorithms or mathematical formulas.

INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING SOFTWARE
All installed applications used on your computing device are managed by the operating system. These
applications may be used to view images, play videos or run tasks on your computing device. There are
different ways of installing software. Examples include custom and default installations.
●●
A custom installation will allow you to see and select parts of the software you want to install.
●●
A full installation will select all parts of the software and install it on your computing device.
●●
Product keys and activation codes: Some applications may give you a unique product key or
activation code once you purchase the application. The installer will then request this product key
before allowing you to install the application.

ORGANISING YOUR FILES
Organising your files refers to the planned system that you use when you save
your files on your computer (stand alone computer or network drive). Well
organised saving of files will allow you quick and easy access to them, avoid
duplication and ensure that your data can be backed up.
To organise your files:
1. Decide on a logical folder structure that can be used to organise your files
and a naming convention.
2. Move existing files to the appropriate location within this folder structure.
3. Save any new files in the appropriate location within this folder structure.
4. Occasionally, check your hard drive to ensure that your new files have not
become disorganised.

AMOUNT OF UNUSED SPACE ON THE HARD DRIVE
Computers need sufficient unused space on the hard drive In order to operate
smoothly. Free space on your drive is required because certain programs/
applications create temporary files whilst in use and the computer system requires
hard disk space to supplement RAM (virtual memory). To free up space on a
drive, there are a few things you can do:
●●
use the disk clean-up tool
●●
uninstall unused software.
●●
empty the recycle bin
●●
compress data not frequently used.

ERRORS AND CORRUPT FILES
Errors and corrupted computer files are files have been damaged or saved
incorrectly and can’t be opened in the normal way.
Files with errors and corrupt files are difficult to detect and they can cause
everything from videos not loading to applications crashing, or even your
operating system not opening.
Regularly scanning for files with errors or corruptfiles using an appropriate utility
(e.g. SMART scan or Disk Check) will warn you before errors become a problem.

INTRODUCTION
Software means computer Instructions or data in the form of operating systems,
utilities, programs, and applications that enable computers to work.
Software can be categorized as systems software or applications software.
System software is a specific type of software that manages a computing device
and comprises of:
●●
the operating system that manages hardware, software and other
applications on a computing device. Functions of the operating system is
grouped into: hardware management, I/O management, process
manamement, file management and memory management.
●●
utility programs that adds functionality to your computer and helps your
computer perform better. These include antivirus, backup, disk repair, file
management, security, and networking programs.
●●
device drivers (software program) that controls a particular type of hardware
device that is attached to a computer.

term 2 I Chapter 6 Software

71

Application software is a program or group of programs designed for end-users.
Applications software include database programs, word processors, web
browsers, spreadsheets, and so on.
Software is becoming smarter, easier to use and better at helping humans than
ever before. Due to rapid improvements and various developments in computer
software (cloud computing, virtual reality, augmented reality and
virtualisation), software is able to do many of the tasks previously left to humans
more reliably and at higher quality, and this include complex tasks like driving a
car, diagnosing cancer or creating legal briefs etc.

6.1

Cloud computing

Cloud computing refers to the process in which computers on the Internet (rather
than local computers) are used to store, manage and process data.
Cloud computing can also be used to run applications (or services) on the Internet
like Google Docs and Microsoft’s Office 365. Cloud computing has made it easier
and cheaper to host a website with 100% uptime.
Cloud computing offers several significant advantages to users:
●●
Scalable: Cloud computing is perfectly scalable, which means that the
capacity of your virtual machine will grow automatically as your requirements
increase.
●●
Affordable: A single virtual machine is affordable, and it only becomes
expensive once you need to rent large numbers of virtual machines.
●●
Reliable: Many cloud computing companies guarantee that the machine will
be available to users always.
●●
Fast: Cloud computers and the Internet connection to these computers can
be incredibly fast.
●●
Maintained: The servers used for cloud computing are maintained by an
expert team who ensure they continue running efficiently.
Thanks to these advantages, most websites and web applications make use of
cloud computers to host their websites.
Each client only pays for the small part of the server they need.

EFFECT ON HARDWARE NEEDS
Cloud computing infrastructure includes server hardware and software, storage,
networking, adequate cooling and security for access control. This can be quite
expensive to set up and maintain. Nowadays most businesses are moving the
support and administration of servers to the cloud as cloud servers are available
anywhere there is an Internet connection.
The virtual servers are built on large hardware platforms so that they can scale up
or down quickly. This is helpful for businesses whos computing infrastructures
changes frequently.

Businesses are becoming more reliant on cloud-based resources and less dependent on traditional IT
hardware and software assets. Businesses employ a hosting provider to manage the hardware and they
can focus on the software.
In the past companies ran multiple operating systems on virtual machines and the servers were often used
at 20% to 30% of capacity. Recently with cloud computing, on-premise hardware will share computing
power with a cloud computing service provider for a monthly subscription fee. This results in companies
doubling the amount of capacity they get with their hardware. Therefore, there is less need for the
purchasing of new servers and hardware.
One negative effect is downtime. For example, when businesses maintain their servers, it causes the
system to be out of action or unavailable for use.

SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS)
SaaS (or Software as a Service) refers to applications that are hosted on the cloud and that users pay a
monthly subscription to access. As the name suggests, SaaS is based on the idea that many software
applications present a service to users. This service might be to provide entertainment, increase productivity
or improve communication.
With SaaS, applications are run on cloud computers and users access these applications through their
web browsers, without any of the applications being installed on their local computer. This works by a
cloud computer in the background performing all the tasks and simply showing the user interface in the
web browser.
Advantages of SAAS
●●
minimal setup required.
●●
minimal initial cost.
●●
software is updated automatically on the cloud computers.
●●
new features are regularly added.
●●
can be used from any computer with an Internet connection.
●●
easier to collaborate or share information with other users.

Case Study

Microsoft Office 2019 vs Microsoft Office 365

Microsoft Office 365 is a service that users subscribe to. Every month or year, users pay a small subscription fee
(between 3% and 5% of Microsoft Office price). Once subscribed, users can download and install all the same
Microsoft Office applications on their computer and between 2 and 5 other devices, use the online versions of the
applications through their web browser, and store up to 1 TB of files on Microsoft OneDrive.

Figure 6.2: Word 365 can be used as a web application
Users who are subscribed to Office 365 are given access to the newest version of Microsoft Office.
The online versions of Office 365 make use of cloud computers to run the software applications, and these
computers are paid for using a part of the users’ monthly subscription fees.
It is important to note that, with SaaS, the subscriber does not own the software, he or she is simply renting it. As a
result, once the SaaS subscriber stops paying their subscription fee, they lose access to the software. The subscriber
does, however, own any work created using the software even if this information is stored on a cloud service.

Virtual Reality (VR)
Virtual reality is an artificial environment that is created with software. It is
computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment.
This is presented to the user in such a way that the user believes and accepts it
as a real environment and becomes completely immersed in that world and shuts
out the physical world. It is primarily experienced through two of the five senses:
sight and sound.

classroom with supporting data.
Healthcare: used for doctors and nurses to learn new skills e.g. surgery
simulation, phobia treatment, robotic surgery and skills training.
Entertainment: for example, interactive theme parks, virtual museums and
theatre.
Fashion: for example, avatars are used to help with clothing design and
virtual stores can be created.
Heritage: for example, visitor centres like the Terracotta Army are being
created in a virtual world so that the site can be protected from tourism.
Business: to train new employers and provide virtual tours of the business
environment.
Engineering: engineers can view their project virtually to understand how it
works, to spot any flaws or potential risks before implementation.
Sport: to measure and analyse athletic performance.
Media: virtual reality is used in producing more realistic films.
Scientific Visualisation: uses computer graphics to show abstract or
complex ideas to show scientific concepts, like molecular models.
Telecommunications: especially with smartphones.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The hardware needed for virtual reality includes:
●●
Personal Computer (PC)/Console/Smartphone are used to process and
power the inputs and outputs sequentially.
●●
Input devices lets users navigate and interact within a VR environment e.g.
joysticks, force Balls/Tracking balls, controller wands, data gloves,
trackpads, On-device control buttons, motion trackers, bodysuits, treadmills
and motion platforms (virtual omni).
●●
Output devices present the VR content or environment to the users and
includes visual, auditory or haptic displays.
Software manages the I/O devices, analyses incoming data and generates proper
feedback. Virtual reality is time-critical and software must manage it. Input data
and the system response that is sent to the output displays must be prompt in
order not to destroy the feeling of immersion.

76

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

ADVANTAGES
There are many advantages to using virtual reality mainly that it can be used as a
training tool in many areas of life and can provide remote access e.g. surgery can
be performed in remote locations using robotic technology and virtual reality. It
provides learning experiences that one cannot get from reading books as it
immerses you in that world. This makes learning fun and can eliminate the
language barrier and certain dangers associated with scientific experiments. This
makes virtual reality a very convenient tool to connect people around the world.

LIMITATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES
The software for virtual reality is limited and in some cases inflexible as it cannot
go out of that scope,
It cannot simulate a real classroom where learning fluctuates,
Virtual reality can be addictive and detrimental to social connections as it is not
real-life, only an imaginary world.

Augmented Reality (AR)
Augmented reality technology superimposes a computer-generated image onto
a user’s view of the real world. It provides a composite 3D view that provides full
immersion. AR can be experienced through headsets that people wear and
through displays on mobile devices.

USES
AR apps, headsets, and smart glasses add value to virtually every industry - from
retail to industrial manufacturing. AR has the potential to solve some of the
biggest problems.
Initially PC, smartphone and tablet applications for augmented reality focused on
games, but the uses of AR has extended far and wide. Listed below are a few
uses of AR technology:
●●
Product view – Allows customers to view and interact with products or
services before purchasing.
●●
Enhance content – Allows users to embed various types of data onto
content. People can point their device at a real-life object to learn whatever
kind of information is necessary, instead of needing to search for it
elsewhere.
●●
Training – AR enables users to train employees more thoroughly than they
can through documentation and meetings. This software allows for trainees
to learn job responsibilities by fully visualizing them, instead of just reading
about job duties.
●●
Productivity – This software enables users to improve workflow and
processes at their business. Factory line workers can spot potential dangers
quicker.
●●
Engage your audience – People are inundated with print and television
advertisements to the point where they don’t pay much attention to them.
Inserting augmented reality into advertisements will catch the eye of your
target demographic.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Hardware requirements for augmented reality include:
●●
battery life
●●
bluetooth connectivity/Wi-Fi
●●
field of view in 3D view
●●
on board storage capacity
●●
on board OS/Web Browser
●●
inputs/outputs (button, eye tracking, accelerometer)
●●
microphone
●●

Virtualisation

Did you know
Even though they are often
mentioned together,
virtualisation is different
from cloud computing.
Virtualisation is the
software that allows you to
create hundreds of virtual
machines on a single virtual
server, while cloud
computing is the service
that uses virtualisation to
rent out small parts of a
server. Virtualisation is
therefore the software,
while cloud computing is
the product sold to
consumers.

Virtualisation refers to running multiple computing environments (called virtual
machines) on a single set of hardware.
On very old operating systems, you could only load and run one program into the
computer’s memory at a time! However, modern processing techniques allow
you to use your CPU more effectively. These processing techniques are:
●●
Multitasking: With multitasking, a single processor splits its time between
different processes.
●●
Multithreading: Multithreading completes the instructions for multiple
different tasks inside the same program (called threads) by quickly switching
between them.
●●
Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing uses many processors to complete
tasks.
These techniques are heavily used in virtualisation, where a single computer can
be broken into many ‘virtual machines’. Each virtual machine is allocated its own
CPU, RAM and storage space and are treated in the same way as a real computer.
This means that each virtual machine must have its own operating system and its
own applications installed, and that the different virtual machines do not have
access to the main computer or any of the other virtual machines.

USES OF VIRTUALISATION
Animation
Animation showing how a
single data centre server is
broken into small pieces,
with each of these pieces
connecting to a different
user on the Internet. The
goal is to show how cloud
computing works by
breaking servers into
hundreds of smaller virtual
machines.

Virtualisation has many different uses, including testing different operating
systems and software, cloning computers, hosting cloud applications and allow
multiple people to use the same computer at the same time.

BENEFITS

Less expenditure: servers, storage and desktops, virtualisation can release
assets, saving in capital and operational expenditure. It can reduce the
number of software licences that are needed.
Save assets: server virtualisation supports multiple applications to operate
on a single physical server, enabling the same assets to be better utilised.
Disaster recovery: options include building in high availability and disaster
recovery processes without replicating everything. The automation
embedded in virtualisation tools supports management processes. It does
not replace them. After all, if systems fail, administrators rely on
management tools to identify where the problems are.
Green IT: with fewer server and storage resources, the demand for power
and cooling can be reduced and there will be fewer units to dispose of.
Long-term benefits: virtualisation starts to change the basic infrastructure,
saving money and establishing a new foundation for on-going
developments. The IT team can show it has answers to help reduce
operating costs and show how every employee can make a contribution to
reducing greenhouse gases.

Computer criminals
You have already learned how to keep your computer safe from malicious
software. You have also seen the techniques websites use to help keep you safe.
So, in this final section on computer security, you will look at the different types of
computer criminals and the targets of their attacks in greater detail.

Figure 7.1: Cyber-criminals use their computer skills to gain access to data

HACKERS
A hacker is anyone who uses their computer skills to gain unauthorised access
to computer systems or data. They can do this through a combination of exploits,
scripts and social engineering.

TYPES OF HACKERS
White hat hackers help companies improve their security by trying to hack into
their computers.
Black hat hackers illegally break into computer systems.

CRACKERS
Cracker refers to Individuals who use their skills illegally. They may break into
computer systems for a variety of reasons, from stealing data to testing their skills
to making political statements.
The word cracker can also be used to refer to people who write software cracks
(tools that allow software to be pirated and used illegally).

CYBER GANGS
A cyber gang, much like a gang in real life, is a group of people who work together
to commit computer crimes. Just like in real life gangs, these gangs can be made
up of many loosely organised members.

VIRUS AUTHOR
A virus author is any person who writes a computer virus. Virus authors create
viruses for several reasons, including causing damage, showing off their skills,
gaining information or money or taking over computers and using them to send
spam emails.
Many security experts will argue that calling a hacker a criminal is also incorrect
since many hackers do not use their computer skills for illegal purposes but are
instead paid by companies to test their security systems.

Types of cyber crimes
In Grade 10 and 11 you learned about different types of computer viruses and
malware attacks. The table below describes five new types of attacks that you
should be aware of:

TYPE

DESCRIPTION

Backdoors

A backdoor refers to any method by which authorized and
unauthorized users are able to get around normal security
measures and gain high level user access on a computer system,
network or software application. (Programmers build backdoors into
their programs to help solve software problems with the program)

Remote access
virus/trojan

A remote access virus (or remote access trojan) allows the virus
author to control the computer it has infected from anywhere in the
world. This can be used to spy on users, record usernames and
passwords and infect their computers with additional viruses.

Botnets

A botnet refers to several computers infected by the same virus
who can work together to perform attacks. These attacks include
sending spam emails, mining bitcoins, or performing a distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. (many computers attempt to use
up all the bandwidth of a website, making it inaccessible).
Each individual computer in a botnet is known as a zombie

Internet fraud

Internet fraud refers to a wide variety of scams used to steal money
from people on the internet. As mentioned in the previous section,
popular scams include sending fake emails and catfishing
(someone who pretends to be someone else online). Other scams
include creating fake charitable organisations after a natural
disaster, selling fake tickets to large sporting or music events, and
creating fake gambling sites with rigged odds.

Activity 7.1
7.1.1 In small groups discuss the types of crimes, the criminals’ reasons for committing
the crimes and the consequences.
7.1.2 Choose one type of cybercrime and research a case study on the crime. Ask your
peers questions on the case study in order to gain further knowledge.

Effects of cyber crime

Cybercrimes can have long lasting effects on the people targeted by it.

Figure 7.2: Cybercrimes have many negative effects on people
Cyber crime is being committed every day. Thieves commit cyber crimes to steal
people’s money and their identity. With your identity, the cyber criminal:
can take out loans, incur credit, accumulate debt and, then flee without a trace.
It can take years to rehabilitate your identity. A virus can destroy someone’s files
and a lost database can result in receiving unwanted sales calls.
The list below includes some of the most immediate effects:
●●
lost money due to online theft
●●
expenses incurred to fix problems and prevent future cybercrimes
●●
loss of reputation due to personal information that is revealed
●●
corrupted files due to viruses
●●
long-term debt created resulting in poor credit rating due to online identity
theft

Activity 7.2
Revisit the case study and questions that you discussed in your small group about a type of
cybercrime. After reading this information, revise your answers and share them with the class.

Computer crimes

Just like you have different types of cyber criminals, you also have different targets with different goals. In
the following section, you will learn about the following types of targets:
●●
Hardware hacking
●●
Software hacking
●●
Information and website hacking
●●
Bandwidth theft
●●
Service theft

HARDWARE HACKING
Hardware hacking refers to attacks aimed at specific pieces of hardware. The goal of these attacks is to
unlock the hardware in order to give the owner access to features that are normally locked.

SOFTWARE HACKING
Software hacking Is achieved by finding software exploits and breaking software protection
When finding software exploits, hackers look for weaknesses in an application’s security. These exploits
are used to gain unauthorised access to the software itself, or gain remote access to the computer.
When breaking software protection, the goal of hackers is to remove the protection which ensures that the
software was purchased and is used legally. This allows people to play pirated games or use pirated
software.

WEBSITE AND INFORMATION HACKING
Hacking a website is ilegally getting the password to add, edit, delete data stored in that website. After
hacking, the hacker will insert harmful programs by inserting malicious codes into the website.
Website and information hacking is used for several different reasons:
●●
Steal users’ personal (email addresses, passwords, credit card information, information) for identity
theft
●●
Build a database of common usernames and passwords
●●
Deface the website or place political messages on the website
●●
Reroute traffic from the website to a phishing website

IDENTITY THEFT
Identity theft happens when a criminal gains access to your personal information and uses that information
to gain some benefit. This can include taking out loans in your name, taking control of your existing bank
or service accounts, creating a phone number in your name, or using your name to commit other illegal
activities.

BANDWIDTH THEFT
Bandwidth theft, occurs when someone links to a file on your website or server from their website. This
video will use your bandwidth for all users viewing the video.

88

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

SERVICE THEFT
Service theft occurs on the Internet whenever someone illegally uses a username
and password to access an online service.

INTERNET RELATED FRAUD SCHEMES
Internet fraud is the use of Internet services or software to defraud victims or to
otherwise take advantage of them. Some examples of Internet related fraud
schemes are: business fraud, credit card fraud, fraudulent investment schemes,
non-delivery of merchandise etc.

INTERNET ATTACKS (WORMS, MALWARE, DENIAL OF SERVICE,
BACK DOORS)
An attack targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting
or maliciously controlling a computing environment or destroying the integrity of
the data or stealing controlled information. Some types of Internet attacks are:
worms, malware, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, Phishing, back doors, drive
by attacks, SQL injection attacks, and so on.

PHISHING
Phishing is an attempt by cybercriminals to obtain sensitive information (usernames,
passwords and credit card details) by posing as legitimate institutions, usually via
an electronic communication.

UNAUTHORISED REMOTE CONTROL AND ADMINISTRATION, FOR
EXAMPLE, BOTNETS, ZOMBIES
Remote administration refers to any method of controlling a computer from
a remote location. Bot programs allow attackers to remotely control vulnerable
computers and form virtual networks of zombies – botnets.

RIGHT TO ACCESS VS RIGHT TO PRIVACY, MISUSE OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION
Individuals and coporate have the right to know where the data originated, the
right to have inaccurate data rectified, a right of recourse in the event of unlawful
processing and the right to withhold permission to use data in some circumstances.
For example, individuals will have the right to opt-out free of charge from being
sent direct marketing material, without providing any specific reason.
Online services require users to provide personal information in order to use their
service. Personal information may include your full name, address, phone
numbers, date of birth, email address, username and password and banking
details. Although personal information is used responsibly online by many
businesses for legitimate communication, it is not always the case and some
personal information can be misused by criminals (used to commit fraud and
identity theft).

Safeguards against computer crimes, threats
and criminals

Cyber/Computer crime cannot be stopped completely. But sometimes it can be prevented with practicing
good online safety habits. Several methods can be used to safeguard against computer crimes, threats
and criminals.
●●
Make sure your security software is current – and update it regularly for protection from malware,
viruses and other online threats.
●●
Lock or log off your computer when you step away to ensure that no one else will have access to all
your information.
●●
Go offline when you don’t need an internet connection to reduce the chances of hackers and virus
scans Invading your computer.
●●
Take advantage of security settings by using PINs or passcodes to protect someone from easily
accessing all your information.
●●
Consider sharing less online. Your birthdate and the city where you live on your social media
profiles can give criminals a more complete picture and make it easier for them to steal your identity.
●●
Think twice about using public Wi-Fi. Avoid entering private information and using apps that have
passwords when you are on public Wi-Fi.
●●
Delete tweets, posts and online advertising, in addition to emails, if it looks suspicious.

INTRODUCTION

INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES IN A NUTSHELL
In the previous years, you learned that the Internet can be grouped into three
generations:
●●
Web 1.0, websites were static with all the information programmed directly
onto the web page. (these web pages stayed the same until a web
developer changed the web page’s code).
●●
Web 2.0: websites became more interactive and dynamic. Instead of simply
providing information, websites became applications that allowed users to
search, send messages, post updates and watch videos. Users also play a
role in the development of content,
●●
Web 3.0: like Web 2.0, but smarter! To cope with the large amounts of
information on the Internet, Internet services created increasingly smarter
web applications to help find and recommend relevant information to
visitors. To do this, Web 3.0 website are much more likely to make use of
the user’s location, preferences etc. to improve the information it provides.

https://tech.co/news/
internet-history-websiteswrote-2015-09
https://qrs.ly/j9a5pj1

One way in which Web 3.0 aims to improve the Internet is by creating a semantic
web. The word semantic refers to the meaning of words and sentences, so the
semantic web will be a web of meanings. Where most of the web is built out of a
collection of web pages connected to each other through hyperlinks, the semantic
web Is a proposed development of the World Wide Web in which data in web

pages is structured and tagged in such a way that it can be read directly by
computers.

c. To cope with the large amounts of information on the Internet, Internet
services must create increasingly smarter web applications to help find and
recommend relevant information to visitors.
d. These are websites that, rather than providing information, provide a service
like desktop applications, with Web 2.0 and 3.0 being closely linked to it.
e. This consists of a massive database containing the data from the WWW in a
logically connected way with the aim to be a collection of data connected
directly to other data, thereby ignoring web pages.

8.1

Improve searching

The smart internet search engines have changed from simply searching for
keywords to answering natural language questions, often before they are even
asked!
Search engines used to work by searching for specific words (or keywords) in the
text of web pages. This type of search is known as keyword search and is a
reasonably good way to search for information. Combined with an effective
ranking system, keyword search will show you the most useful websites
containing your keywords.
However, keyword searches struggle to answer questions. Since the keyword
search does not know what the individual words mean, all it can do is to look for
pages where those keywords are found on the page. As a result, the search
results often include pages containing the keywords that are unrelated to the
question being asked. Searches may also fail to find web pages that do answer
the question but use different keywords.
In the following sections, you will see how improvements to semantic search and
mediated search hopes to improve your search results.

SEMANTIC SEARCH
Semantic refers to the meaning of words and sentences, a semantic search
engine is a search engine that searches for answers based on the meaning of the
search, rather than on the keywords (i.e improve search accuracy by
understanding a searcher›s intent through contextual meaning)
If you search for: ‘What is the semantic web? then a semantic search engine will
attempt to answer this question (and show definitions, articles and advantages,
advantages of the semantic web), while a keyword search engine will show you
web pages containing the words ‘What’, ‘is’, ‘the’, ‘semantic’ and ‘web’

MEDIATED SEARCH
Disagreements are mediated, that means a neutral person has stepped in to
help. Most websites provide a search facility within the site. Rather than each
website creating their own, basic search engine, mediate search allows websites
to make use of an advanced search engine like Google to power search their
website. When a user enters a search query, it runs the query through a search
engine like Google or Bing but limits the results to the specific website. These
results can then be shown directly inside the web page, like any other search
query would be. This allows small website creators to use the most powerful
search engines in the world on their website.

Figure 8.1: Geology.com makes use of mediated search

SEO (SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION)
SEO is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website
through search engine results. A search engine has a crawler (systematically
browsers the WWW) that gathers information available on the Internet. The
crawlers bring that data back to the search engine in order to build an index.
When you type in a query or phrase in the search engine, it tries to match all that
data using an algorithm. The index is then fed through that algorithm and a long
list of links to webpages that could potentially answer your question is provided.

8.2

Online applications
Online (web) applications work using the IPO model of input, processing, storage
and output. In this section, you will learn about three of these steps, namely:
●●
how data is stored,
●●
how instructions are run (or processed) and
●●
how the output is formatted.

STORING DATA
Deciding where to store the data usually depends on the number of users who
need to access the data and the size of the data. As with processing, web
applications can choose to store data either locally or online.

LOCALLY
Web application creators also store data about the user locally in a cookie. While
cookies were initially used to store a user’s preferences (such as their language
preference) for a website, they have recently been used to store all kinds of
different information about the user. This includes information on the times a user
visits the website, how long the user stays on the website, the links the user
clicked on and the physical location of the user while browsing the website.

ONLINE
Data that needs to be accessible to more than one user, or to the same user on
more than one computer, will usually be stored online. As a result, information like
status updates and tweets are stored online since this data should be accessible
to any user searching for it. In contrast, WhatsApp messages are stored directly
on the smartphones that received them. Unless these messages are backed up,
they will not appear on a new phone.
Once the data has been stored in an appropriate location, it needs to be used on
the website once the website has been loaded. To do this, website creators
make use of several different tools, including:
●●
SQL: (short for Structured Query Language) is a standard language for
working with databases. SQL is incredibly important for websites where the
data is stored in a database, since SQL queries can then be used to search
for and display this data.
●●
Scripting languages (like PHP or JavaScript): a programming language
that work inside very specific situations (such as web pages) to automatically
complete tasks.
●●
XML: (Extensible Mark-up Language) is a language used to describe, store
and transport data.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
During processing, applications run a set of predetermined instructions. These
instructions might be as simple as HTML code that tells the web page what
information to display, or it may be millions of lines of complicated search code
running in the background. These instructions can either be run on a local
computer or they could be run on a virtual machine somewhere on the cloud.

98

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

LOCAL COMPUTER
With local (or client-side) scripts, all the code that will be run must be stored in the
code of the web page. This is usually done in the form of a JavaScript or PHP
script. One common use of local scripts on websites is to show a pop-up
message about cookies or ad blockers. When users accept the terms and
conditions or click on the Close button, a small local script runs which removes
the pop-up message from the page.
Another popular use of local scripts is known as AJAX (or Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML), which allows you to update or refresh a small part of a web
page without reloading the entire page. AJAX is used on thousands of websites
to display new information that is requested from a web server without updating
the entire page. Examples include Facebook showing new status updates or
Twitter informing you of new tweets without refreshing the page.
While local scripts can be quick to run and remove a lot of processing from the
web servers, they have several problems:
●●
They can cause the user’s computer or the website to slow down.
●●
They may require the user to download the entire script each time the
website is opened.
●●
The scripts are visible, allowing anyone to see and copy the script for their
own programs.

QR CODE

https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=RDo3hBL1rfA
Short Link

ONLINE
For these reasons, many web applications run their instructions online, on a web
server. With server-side processing, the instructions are not downloaded as part
of the web page. Instead, the web page simply displays data that is generated
and sent to it by instructions running on the server. For example, many websites
use SQL scripts to collect information from a database and display it on a page.

FORMATTING OUTPUT
Online applications are evaluated on the way they look and feel, so website
creators spend a lot of time formatting their output.

Did you know
Most web applications (like
Facebook) use local scripts
to perform simple tasks
(such as updating the
page), while processing the
more complex instructions
on a web server.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. HTML is used to structure a web
document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to
embed images, video, and other media). CSS specifies your document’s style—
page layouts, colors, and fonts. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house
has one), and CSS as the aesthetic.
One way to change the output of a web application is to change the website’s
CSS (or cascading style sheets). CSS determines how a website will look by
creating a style sheet. This style sheet contains information on all the styles used
throughout the website. Rather than manually changing the style of each
paragraph of text, each heading and each image, CSS allows web application
creators to create a style for these items.

INTRODUCTION
In Grade 10 and Grade 11, you learned that networks are incredibly powerful
tools that most modern people and businesses depend on daily. Networks have
thousands of different uses, including:
●●
communication
●●
sharing resources
●●
centralisation of data
●●
transfer of files
●●
increased productivity
●●
leisure.
These uses help to make life easier, more enjoyable, makes people more
productive, saves time and money, increases social opportunities and can
improve knowledge.

term 3 I Chapter 9 Networks

105

NETWORKS IN A NUTSHELL
Networks can be categorised based on their size. A local area network (or LAN) is a computer network
that covers a small area like a home, office or building. LANs usually have a limited number of computers
connected to them (between 2 and 25), and these computers can be connected to the network using
either ethernet or Wi-Fi. Once connected, the computers on the network can share resources, transfer
files and communicate.
A WAN is a network that covers a large area – which could include all the people in a suburb or city, but
it is most often used to refer to the internet, the world’s largest WAN. Unlike LANs, many WANs are not
private but are instead organised by communities or businesses. To join a WAN (like the internet) you need
to seek permission from a company that manages the service.
Another way to categorise networks is based on the way computers on the network are connected to
each other. Client-server networks are managed by one or more servers. These servers make sure that
everyone can access the network, that people only have access to the correct resources and that
problems on the network are resolved. Many client’s computers can then connect to these servers and
make use of the resources they provide. However, client computers on a client-server network can often
not see each other.
In contrast, in a peer-to-peer (p2p) network there is no central computer, server or person that manages
the network. Instead, each computer on the network connects directly to the network and the other
computers on the network. Peers on this network are visible to each other and can share files and
resources with each other. You will learn more about peer-to-peer networks and filesharing in this chapter.

9.1

Essential parts to link nodes

A link node connects processing locations or nodes, like a computer or a printer.
Networks are grouped into two types of networks: wired networks and wireless
networks. To create a wired network, you need the following networking equipment:
●●
Switch
●●
Network cable
●●
Wireless base station

SWITCH
A switch or router are devices that allow multiple computers to connect to the
same network. They can also be used to connect two networks to each other.
A switch serves as a controller, enabling networked devices to talk to each other
efficiently.
A router connects multiple networks together. They also connect computers on
those networks to the internet. Routers enable all networked computers to share
a single internet connection.

Did you know
Switch and router can be
used interchangeably since
modern routers come with
a switch.

Figure 9.1: Switches allow multiple computers to connect to the same network

NETWORK CABLES
Network cables are used to connect a
computer to a local area network or one
network to another network. If you are
connecting directly to the internet, you
may require a specific cable based on the
type of internet you are using such as a
DSL enabled phone cable or a fibre
optic cable.

Figure 9.2: An ethernet cable is made
up of four twisted pairs of wires

WIRELESS BASE STATION
A wireless base station is a radio receiver/transmitter that serves as the hub of a
local wireless network. It may also be used to link a wired network and the
wireless network. It consists of a low-power transmitter and wireless router. It is
basically a router that communicates with devices based on the Wi-Fi standard.
The router creates a connection between two or more networks, usually a local
network and the internet. This allows all computers on the local network to
connect to the internet. Since most routers have multiple ethernet ports, routers
can often be used as an ‘all-in-one’ solution, instead of using switches in small
home and office networks.

Connecting to the internet

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable not only installing the hardware, but also choosing
an appropriate internet connection for your household.

ROUTER OR MODEM
Routers and modems look similar but they each serve a different purpose.

ROUTER
A router is a small box that allows multiple computers to join the same network. Early routers only had
Ethernet ports for wired connections, but now modern routers also provide wireless connectivity. They
allow multiple computers and other devices, like smartphones and tablets, to join the same network.
Most routers have a specific Ethernet port that is designed to connect to the Ethernet port of a cable or
DSL modem.

MODEM
A modem is a device that provides access to the internet. It connects to your ISP, which typically provides
either cable or ADSL internet service. Cable modems connects to a cable port on the wall like a telephone
socket.

ACCESSING THE INTERNET
An ISP (Internet Service Provider) can provide you with either a wired or a wireless connection to the
internet. In most situations, your ISP will provide you with the hardware you need to connect to the
internet. However, if they do not you will need to ensure you have the following three pieces of hardware:
●●
computer
●●
internet connection channel
●●
internet communication device.
The table below summarises the needed for the different types of internet.

When you have connected the router to the internet, you need to create a
connection between the router and your local area network and computers.
One way to do this is by connecting computers directly to the router using Wi-Fi
or ethernet cables, as shown in Figure 9.3. In this figure, a router connects to the
internet using LTE, and multiple devices (including a smartphone and a PC)
connect to the router using Wi-Fi

network’s switch. This allows all the computers on the local area network to
connect to the internet.

ALL-IN-ONE SOLUTION
All-in-one solution is to have a contract with an internet service provider (ISP). The
ISP will charge you a monthly fee and, in return, allow you to use their network to
connect to the internet. Most ISPs will also help you to set up your internet
connection, from making sure you have the correct hardware to installing the
telephone lines and setting up you the internet account.

Sharing concepts

FILES AND FOLDERS
One of the biggest advantages of networks, , is the ability to share files and folders on one computer with
other computers on the network. Once shared, people on the network can open and view the files or
folders or they can copy the files to their own computers. Depending on the setup, these users might also
be allowed to modify the files or delete the files.

USER RIGHTS
User rights allow you to set permissions for your shared files, giving different users access to use your files
in different ways (such as reading, writing or modifying the files). In this way, it is possible to allow most
users to simply read the files, while specific users can modify or update the files.
Example: on a school network, students are often able to write files to personal folders stored on a
network but blocked from writing or changing files from other students’ folders. However, the network
administrator can see or change files from any student’s folder.
The advantages of using user rights are:
●●
It allows you to specify, in detail, which users have access to your files.
●●
It allows only specific users to change your files. This decreases the risk of viruses infecting your
computer and users deleting your files.
The disadvantages of using user rights are:
●●
It is more time consuming and difficult to set up.
●●
It may require you to make changes to the user rights as new users are added.
●●
It may require you to make changes as user’s needs change.
●●
Some programs on a shared folder will not function if a user does not have full user rights.

BITTORRENT
BitTorrent (or torrents) is a peer-to-peer technology that can be used to share files. What makes torrent
files unique is that they do not rely on a single peer sharing a file with lots of peers. Instead, anyone who
downloads a torrent file automatically starts sharing it with other people. This means that if you have
downloaded 10% of a shared file using torrents, you also share that 10% with new people who start to
download the file.
Torrents facilitate the sharing of bandwidth allowing users to download files more quickly than they would
from a single source.

BENEFITS
Torrents have many benefits, especially for people or organisations who need to share files with many
people:
●●
The data used to upload the file is shared between all the users downloading the file.
●●
The bandwidth is also shared, allowing users to download the file more quickly.
●●
Since the file is not uploaded to a single website or hosted by a single user, people may continue
to share it for years after it was first shared.
●●
For websites using torrents to share pirated material, the website itself is not sharing the illegal
materials nor the files linking to the illegal materials. This makes it a lot harder to prosecute the
website owners for copyright infringement.

112

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

DISADVANTAGES
Torrent files also carry several risks:
●●
Since the files are shared peer-to-peer, you can never be sure that the file you are downloading is
what you are looking for. Many users have used torrent files to share viruses.
●●
Many ISPs throttle or shape torrent downloads, preventing you from downloading them at high speed.
●●
Torrents are often used to pirate videos and music. When you use torrents to download pirated
material, you are also personally sharing pirated material with other people. Distributing pirated
material is punished much more severely by the law than receiving pirated material.
Due to these advantages and disadvantages, the primary use of torrents is for downloading and sharing
pirated television shows, movies, music and software. However, there are a few companies who share
large applications (such as Linux installations) using torrents. The distributed nature of the sharing also
makes it a good way to share massive files.

Figure 9.5: BitTorrent can be used to legally download applications like Ubuntu

ONLINE SERVICES
Sharing files on a local network makes those files only available to the people able who are already
connected to your network. If you want to share files with people on the internet (for example, share a
group work project with friends), then you need to use an online service.
Online Services are organizations that provides an information service over the Internet. Examples are
search engines, cloud storage services and application service providers.
Four popular online services are:
●●
Drop box: A popular cloud storage service from Dropbox, Inc. that is used to transfer abd
synchronize files between desktop and mobile devices.
●●
MobileMe: A service that ensures your iPhone and computer are always in sync. It updates
calendars, contacts and emails wirelessly. This online service Is being discontinued.
●●
GSuite: (formerly Google Apps) for Work is a suite of web applications created by Google for
businesses. Includes Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more.
●●
Office 365 online: Lets you view and edit Office documents for free in your web browser
(like Google Docs, but from Microsoft). All the same apps – Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and
OneNote – are available.

Remote access

Remote access refers to several technologies or applications that allow you to connect to a computer
over the network. Once connected with remote access, you will see the remote computer’s display on
your monitor, and you can use this computer as if it is your own computer. Generally remote access Is
used for: opening applications, sending emails and fixing problems.

LOCAL NETWORK
Local network is remote access that allows you to connect to a computer on your local network and use
it as if it was your own computer. However, you cannot simply use remote access to take over other
people’s computers! For you to use it, the following requirements must be met:
●●
The remote computer must have remote access enabled.
●●
You must be on the same local network
as the remote computer.
●●
You must know the IP address of the
remote computer.
●●
You must know the username and
password for the remote computer.
Once these requirements have been met,
you can use the Windows Remote Desktop
Connection application to connect to the
remote computer.

Figure 9.6: Remote Desktop Connection

ONLINE REMOTE ACCESS
While accessing a computer on the local network is useful, doing this over the internet is much more
useful. This allows you to manage your home computer from school, or your work computer from home.
It also allows you to connect to your friends’ or family’s computers from anywhere in the world, if both of
you have internet connections.
To use online remote access, you need to install specialised software (such as TeamViewer) on both
computers. Once installed, you can use the remote computer’s ID and password to access it online.

REMOTE ACCESS USING A VPN
A VPN (or virtual private network) is a private network that you can connect to over the internet. It is a
service that encrypts your online traffic, enabling you to access the internet with complete privacy and
security. Once you are connected to the VPN, you can access all the private network resources (such as
shared files, printers and computers) as if you were physically connected to the private network.
Once connected to the virtual network, you can use remote access to connect to a computer on the VPN
like you would connect to any local computer.
While accessing a computer on the local network is useful, doing this over the internet is much more

INTRODUCTION
E-communication, or electronic communication, is a type of communication
between people in the form of texting, signals, data, sounds, images, signs or
intelligence sent via an electronic device. Some examples of e-communication
include email, text messages, social media messaging and image sharing.
Security measures that can be taken to protect e-communication from cyber
criminals is discussed in this Chapter.

Case Study

Cyber-attacks on government websites

There are concerns about the lack of security measures on government websites after a
cyber-attack on the official Presidency website. According to Independent Online, the
Presidency’s website was hacked on Saturday by an unknown group who posted:
“Hacked by Black Team. Sahara is Moroccan. And Morocco is ur Lord!”.
Information technology security specialists say that if it was so easy to attack a website
like that of the Presidency, what other computer systems and websites with sensitive
information will be hacked. There have been previous hacks of government websites
such as, the departments of Education and Home Affairs which exposed the data of
more than 30 million South Africans and SAPS where sensitive information, including
that of whistle-blowers, had been compromised.
Cybercriminals are getting more advanced and find ways to hack websites where there
are vulnerabilities in software. This cyber-attack caused South Africans to think twice
before they shared any personal information with government entities online.
Professor Basie Von Solms, director of the Centre for Cyber Security at the University of
Johannesburg said, ‘What could help was the implementation of the Protection of
Personal Information Act which required organisations to put in measures that would
ensure people’s data is kept safe and follow international best practices.’

UNIT

10.1 Overview of security concepts
Since e-communication is online there is a chance of cyber criminals getting
hold of the information. Security measures that can be taken are discussed in
this Chapter.

ENCRYPTION
Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way
that only authorised parties can access it. With encryption, any data sent between
two computers is changed from something that is useful to encrypted data that
meaningless and extremely difficult for unauthorised parties to decrypt. The only
way to turn the encrypted data back into useful data is to know the encryption
key, which is only known by the receiving computer. The encrypted message,
data or information can only be decoded by another entity if they have access to
a decryption key.

PURPOSE OF ENRYPTION
By encrypting personal data such as usernames and passwords, websites
provide an extra layer of protection for users. With encryption, even if the website
is hacked and its database stolen, the hackers cannot see the usernames and
passwords without the encryption key. Since the encryption key is stored
separately, the encrypted data remains safe.

HOW DOE ENCRYPTION WORK?
Imagine entering your password on your online banking website. A clever hacker
might place himself in-between you and your bank. Any messages you send to
your bank (such as your password), therefore first passes through the hacker’s
computer before going to your bank. If your data is not encrypted, the hacker can
easily read your password before sending it to your bank. Neither you, nor your
bank, might know that the password is stolen, and the hacker can use the
password to steal your money!
Websites that have HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) in theirURL are
using encryption. Most online services today also encrypt personal user information
in their databases, which means that, even if a hacker gets access to the database,
they cannot just read all the user’s usernames and passwords. Instead, they will
only see encrypted usernames and password, which useless to them.

SSL (PRIVATE AND PUBLIC)
When you enter data on a normal HTTP website, the data is sent to the website
as plain, unencrypted text. Hackers can use several different techniques to
intercept this message and gain access to your username and password. This is
especially problematic when you are doing online shopping, since anyone
intercepting your purchase message can steal your credit card information!

https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=rROgWTfA5qE
https://qrs.ly/4wa5pk3

120

To stop this from happening, websites can use HTTPS to encrypt any traffic sent
from the user to the website, and from the website to the user. HTTPS does this
by using SSL (or Secure Sockets Layer).

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

PURPOSE OF SSL (SECURE SOCKET LAYER)
SSL adds a security layer to any web page. Any message that is sent
to the website first passes through the security layer (which encrypts
the message) before travelling to the website. When the website
returns information, this information is once again sent through the
secure layer and encrypted before being sent to the user. Because of
SSL, anyone who intercepts information sent or received on an HTTPS
page will simply receive a scrambled, encrypted message that is
useless to them.
To see if a website is secure, you can look at the protocol it uses as well
as the small lock icon next to its URL.

Figure 10.1: Secure websites use the HTTPS
protocol and have a lock next to the URL

SSL (PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEY)
If a user needs a website’s encryption key to decrypt any information he or she
receives, and the website needs the user’s encryption key to decrypt any
information they send, then how do they share these keys? Websites use public
and private keys to encrypt information.

PUBLIC KEY
The public key is public, which means that all the messages you send and all
information you submit on the Internet contains this public key. Even though
hackers can easily see this public key, they cannot use it to unlock information
encrypted with the public key. To unlock this information, they need your private
key. Unlike your public key, your private key is kept a secret by your computer
and never shared with anyone.

Animation
Animation showing
information locked with a
public key then unlocked
with a private key, then
locked with a private key
and unlocked with a
public key.

Whenever your computer visits a new website, you exchange public keys. You
send the website your own public key, and the website sends its public key to
you. When the website then sends you information, it encrypts it twice: Once with
website’s private key and once with your public key.

Animation
Animation showing information locked with user’s public
key and locked with the website’s private key. This
information is then sent from the website to the user.
The animation should show the information having two
locks on it at the end.

Since the information has been encrypted twice (with the website’s private key
and with your public key), you will need two keys: The website’s public key (to
decrypt its private key)

term 3 I Chapter 10 E-communications I Unit 10.1 Overview of security concepts

121

YOUR PRIVATE KEY (TO DECRYPT YOUR PUBLIC KEY)

Animation
Animation showing the
information locked twice
being unlocked with the
website’s public key and
the user’s private key, and
then becoming legible.

Since the website’s public key is public, you (and any hackers) know the public
key and can remove the first set of encryptions using the public key. However,
since only you know your own private key, only you can remove the last set of
encryptions from the information. This means that only your computer can fully
decrypt the information to understand it.
When you return a message to the website, you encrypt it using your own private
key and the website’s public key before sending it. The website therefore needs
your public key (which everyone has), and its own private key (which only it has)
to decrypt the information. In this way, you can send information to the website
so that only it can decrypt it.

CERTIFICATES AND SECURITY
Before your browser can encrypt and send any data to a website using SSL, it
first requests the website’s SSL certificate. Websites use this certificate to prove
their identity. To obtain an SSL certificate, websites must apply for a
certificate with a certification authority.
All SSL certificates should contain the following information:
The domain name (or subject) the certificate is valid for
●● The certificate authority who created (or issued) the certificate
●● The dates the certificate is valid for
●●

This is shown in the figure in the margin.

PURPOSE OF SSL CERTIFICATES:

Figure 10.2: Figure 10.2: An SSL certificate

Before you can send any personal or encrypted information to a website,
your browser will first compare the certificate it receives with the certificate
from the certification authority. If it finds any mistakes, or receives an
outdated certificate, it will warn you that the certificate it received is not
legitimate and stop you from sending personal information to the website.

SSL therefore not only ensures that any information you send and receive is
encrypted, by using certificates, it also ensures that the encrypted information is
only sent to the correct websites (and not to malicious or phishing websites).

FIREWALLS
On computers, firewalls prevent malicious users and viruses from sending data to
and receiving data from your computer. There are three general types of firewalls:
●●
Software firewalls that are installed on the user’s computer and protects a
single computer.
●●
Software firewalls that are installed on a server or router that protects all the
computers on the network.
●●
Hardware firewalls that are installed between a local network and the
internet and protects all the computers on the network.

122

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

Firewalls work by allowing any data you request or send to go through the firewall,
while blocking any unrequested information from passing through the firewall.
This allows you to access the internet and use it as normal but stops malicious
users on the internet from sending viruses to your computer. Whenever you run
a new program that uses the internet on your computer, your firewall will ask you
whether to allow this program to send and receive data.
Today, most operating systems have a built-in firewall. This means you do not
need to worry about installing a separate firewall. Instead, you should make sure
that you only allow programs you to pass data through the firewall.

SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS IN A NUTSHELL
According to the United Nations, globalisation can be defined as an increase in
the rate and ease with which people, companies and governments from different
countries interact.
Globalisation has been made possible due to two technologies: transportation
and improvements in computers and computer networks.
Globalisation has made the world richer, smarter, more connected and more
culturally aware than ever before.

term 3 I Chapter 11 Social implications

Computers make global communication easy and affordable. This has several
advantages, including:
●●
allowing families to keep in touch, even over large distances.
●●
helping people to keep and maintain larger social networks.
●●
increasing people’s social and romantic opportunities.
●●
improving job opportunities, with many young South Africans finding
opportunities overseas.
●●
helping people understand different points of view, with research showing
how communicating with different people can increase empathy.
One communication technology that has already had a significant impact and will
continue to grow in popularity as internet speeds increase, is video conferencing.
Video conferencing allows two or more people to connect to the same video call.
This has significant advantages over a typical phone call or teleconference call,
including:
●●
a large part of communication is through facial expressions and body
language
●●
video conferences allow users to visually show what they are talking about.
The benefits of global communication are not just personal. Companies have
their own advantages including:
●●
selling their products to a global (international) audience.
●●
managing larger, international businesses using video conferences.
●●
sending critical documents across the world immediately using email.
●●
quickly transferring and receiving funds between countries and from
international customers through online banking.

Computers provide solutions to issues of national
and international importance

INTRODUCTION
In Grade 11, you saw how computers can be used to solve real world problems. This included specific
case studies on the weather, elections and censuses, but also included a more general discussion of new
technologies, including AIs that can diagnose cancer and create legal briefs and self-driving cars.
In this section, you will look at two new techniques that programmers use to solve problems:
●●
Distributed computing
●●
Decision making

DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING POWER
Distributed computing refers to computer projects where hundreds, or even thousands, of computers
across the world work together to solve a problem, for example, the free, online game called Phylo.
In this game, players could use coloured blocks to build DNA and were asked to compare DNA sequences
between different species. The closer the match, the higher score players would receive.

Figure 11.1: Phylo asked gamers to compare DNA sequences using coloured blocks
While the game itself was interesting, it was a distributed computing
project. The goal of Phylo was not just to entertain people, but also to help
align DNA sequences correctly and to recognise patterns that computers
struggle to recognise. By playing the game, the gamers helped researchers
to better understand several different diseases.
Similar distributed computing power has been used to:
●●
Find a solution for the Ebola virus
●●
Find a solution for certain strains of childhood cancer
●●
Find new prime numbers
●●
Categorise galaxies
●●
Search for alien life
●●
Fight AIDS
By allowing people who care about a topic to pool their resources, the
creators of these projects gain access to an incredible amount of resources
that they might not have had on their own.

Did you know
GIMPS, or the Great
internet Mersenne Prime
Search, is a distributed
computing project to find
large prime numbers.
Anyone who runs the
software and finds a new,
undiscovered prime
number receives a cash
prize of roughly R50 000.
Anyone finding a prime
with more than 100 million
digits will receive a prize of
almost R2 400 000! The
largest prime number
discovered by 2018 has
23,25 million digits.

DECISION MAKING
Computers have changed, and is continuing to change, human decision making.
For thousands of years, people have seen human intelligence and the ability of
humans to make decisions as the primary difference between humans from
animals. Over the last 30 years, and especially the last 10 years, humans are
giving up more and more of their decision-making responsibility to computers.
This ranges from decisions as simple as when to do exercise or which road to
take to work, to potentially life changing decisions such as which romantic
partners would suit you and what job occupations would suit you.
As computers become more intelligent and learn more about us, they will
undoubtedly play an even bigger role in human decision making.

the statements below:
i. Humans will always be able to make better complex decisions than
computers.
ii. Soon, computers will be able to do most jobs, including knowledge jobs
such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, better than humans.
iii. Soon, your computer and smartphone will be able to analyse all the
information It has recorded about you and your friends and provide you with
concrete social suggestions such as “You need to spend more time with
Mark” or “You and Relebohile would make an excellent couple.”
iv. The more decisions computers can make; the easier life will be for humans.
v. When you allow computers to make too many decisions, you place too
much power in the hands of computer programmers.

The evolution of social networking and the effect
on society

INTRODUCTION
Using computers, the internet and social websites have made significant improvements to the world. They
have made it easier for people to be more social, made it easier to connect with people who are far away,
made communication more affordable, made it easier to find a community of similar people, and allowed
people to begin building databases of the world’s knowledge. At the same time, it is important to stay
aware of the potential risks and problems linked to these improvements.

INFORMATION OVERLOAD
While social networks do allow people to stay connected to their
friends, they can also lead to social media information overload.
This occurs when there is too much information available, with new
messages, photos and notifications demanding your attention every
minute of the day. Rather than spend their time productively, people
can spend every free minute they have reading social media posts
making them less productive, less able to obtain new information,
more stressed and can even cause depression!

Figure 11.2: Social media overload
can cause depression

If you find yourself spending too much time on social media, you can try the following:
●●
Limit the time you spend on social networks to five minutes, three times a day
●●
Do not save your username and password, so that you are forced to enter these each time
●●
Unfollow or mute people who fill your social media page with useless information
●●
Disable social media notifications on your phone
●●
Uninstall or stop using any services that do not improve your life

AVAILABILITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
PERSONAL INFORMATION
Social networks like Facebook and Twitter are a great way to keep in touch with
friends and acquaintances. They can also be used to meet new people with
common interests and talk about the things you have in common. At the same
time, unless you specifically change it, most social networks share a lot of the
information that you place on their website publicly. This means that anyone on
the internet can see this information.

Figure 11.3: Facebook shares a lot of information publicly, unless you specify differently
This can result in uncomfortable family moments when your parents see exactly
what you did during the holiday with your friends! It can also have more permanent,
long-term consequences, such as costing you a job. In today’s competitive job
market, there is a growing trend for employers to look at the social media profiles
of applicants before making any hiring decisions
Publicly available online information has also been used to commit crimes.
Burglars have used tweets or public photos to see when families are away from
home or on vacation. This allowed them to burgle houses at a time they knew the
houses would be empty. Stalkers have also used publicly posted information
(such as tweets or photos on Instagram) to stalk their victims.

Stalking and social media

SEARCH ENGINES AND GROUP COMMUNICATIONS
Consequences of search engines
Every search engine consists of some algorithm that determines how the engine
searches the database and shows the results of the search. Web sites hope to make a
profit on their business enterprises at some point. If you understand the significant role
search engines play in the web surfing behavior of internet users, you can see the value
a corporation might place in having its web site be returned as the first and ‘most
appropriate’ result of a search engine’s search. ‘Ask google’: results in people having
poor recall of knowledge if they knew where answers to questions were easily found.
Consequences of group communications
Many people go through their lives feeling like they do not fit in. They might have
different interests or different beliefs from the people around them, or they may feel
awkward in social contexts.
One of the big advantages of social websites is that it allows users to find like-minded
people who share their interests and beliefs. For many people, the internet is a place
where they can show a part of themselves that they feel the need to hide in real life.
The downside of finding like-minded individuals is that it allows people to create a
context in which their ideas are never challenged. Today, you can go online and speak
with thousands of people who share your beliefs, reinforcing your (incorrect) beliefs.
As a result, rather than using the internet to expand their horizons and encounter new
people with new ideas, people often surround themselves with too many similar people,
strengthening their existing (and often bad) ideas. This is particularly problematic with
racist social network groups where users can surround themselves with people sharing
and speaking about their racism, rather than surrounding themselves with people who
will challenge these views.

Case Study

Social, political, environmental
Social
Recent research found that almost a quarter of the world’s population is now on
Facebook. Social networks grow more powerful with the increase in interactions among
people on social platforms. People can find others like them, with their beliefs through
social media. People can also create memes (an image, video, piece of text, etc.,
typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users),
publications, Virtual online worlds, and so on.
Some people believe that social media encourages people to use mobile devices to
express their concerns on social issues without engaging actively with real life
campaigns. Their support is limited to pressing the ‘Like’ button or sharing content.
Political
Social networks play an increasingly important role in electoral politics. Social networks
are helping to fundamentally rewire human society. Social media lets people freely
communicate with one another and they are helping to create influential social
organisations among once-marginalised groups.

Environmental
Social media increasingly supports environmental campaigns and connects people on
major environmental issues such as climate change. It also provides people with the
ability to track the quality of the air and water around them and then share this data
with others. Social media has propelled the rise of the independent activist. For
example, when Cape Town went through water restrictions, many people shared their
personal views and tips on saving water on social media. This brings about an
awareness that otherwise might have gone unnoticed.

Activity 11.4

Social websites

This activity can either be a discussion in class or learners can answer the questions
individually in their homework books.
11.4.1 How do you feel about social, political and environmental communities?
11.4.2 Do you belong to any of these communities?
11.4.3 Do the people in this community share most of your opinions?
11.4.4 How likely are you to encounter people with different opinions?
11.4.5 Do you think the internet is making it easier or harder to become an activist?

GLOBAL COMMUNITY – CULTURAL EFFECTS
Globalisation allows people from across the world to form part of a global
community where everyone can share and enjoy other people’s cultures. For
example, most people today watch international movies and listen to international
music. There are also many people who are interested in and follow international
news.
The risk with the global community is that smaller cultures may disappear. In
South Africa, especially among young people who rely on the internet for
entertainment, many people rarely watch South African television shows or listen
to South African music. Many people are also more interested in international
than local affairs, and more interested in international celebrities than local
celebrities. This constant focus on international entertainment, news and people
can increase the cultural attraction to countries with a large cultural impact (such
as the United States) while decreasing the power of smaller cultures.
For many people, culture is an important part of a person’s identity, so losing your
own culture, or seeing your culture as second to an international culture attacks
that identity.
Groups consisting of people with different cultures can improve the groups’
performance.
If all small cultures are swallowed by larger, more dominant cultures, some unique
ideas and perspectives on the world could disappear.

SOCIAL WEBSITES AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING
A few examples ways In whichh social engineering is practiced include:
●●
Baiting: This depends on a victim taking the bait, similar to a fish reacting to
a worm on a hook. The person dangling the bait wants to entice the target
into taking action e.g. unknowingly downloading malware on a server.
●●
Phishing: This grabs information from an unwitting victim to seek information
that might help with a more significant crime.
●●
Email hacking and contact spamming
●●
Pretexting: Is a trick to get someone’s attention so the fraudster can trick the
would-be victim into providing something of value.
●●
Quid pro quo: This scam involves an exchange, I give you this, and you give
me that. Fraudsters make the victim believe it’s a fair exchange, but that’s far
from the case, as the cheat always comes out on top.

WIKIS
Wikis are encyclopaedias that can be edited by anyone. They can be general
encyclopaedias (like Wikipedia) which allows users to create entries for any topic,
or they can be very specific, such as the esports Wiki called Liquipedia, which
only allows users to add information on the esports-related topics.

Figure 11.4: Wikipedia is an example of a general wiki
Because anyone can contribute information to the wiki, these encyclopaedias
can grow incredibly quickly. For example, Wikipedia contributors have written
and edited more than 27 billion words across 40 million articles! If the average
professional author can write 100 000 words in a year, it would have taken a team
of 1 000 professional authors 270 years and hundreds of billions of Rand to
create an encyclopaedia as large as Wikipedia. Instead, the information on
Wikipedia was written and edited in less than 18 years for free!
Since anyone can update a wiki, they are also easier to maintain and keep up to
date. Whenever a large event occurs, hundreds of contributors are ready to
update the wiki with the newest information.
This does not, however, suggest that wikis are perfect. Instead wikis are faced
with several challenges, including:
●●
Quality of information: Because anyone can edit the information, many
people doubt the quality of information stored on wikis. However, several
studies have shown the quality of information on Wikipedia is comparable to
that of top encyclopaedias written by experts.
●●
Bias of editors: Since anyone can edit an article, rather than those with a
neutral view of the topic, are most likely to edit the pages. This means that
there are often edit wars about controversial topics, with one group of
editors writing the article so that the information is positive, and another
group so that the information is negative.

134

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

While these criticisms have mostly looked at Wikipedia, this is because Wikipedia
is by far the largest and best moderated wiki. These issues become even more
significant on smaller wikis, where a small number of contributors can have a
large impact on the quality of the wiki.

Non-diverse editors:
The bias of the
information may not
always be intentional. A
2013 study found that
90% of Wikipedia’s
editors were men. As a
result, the information
on Wikipedia may be
biased towards men.
Vandalism: Vandalism
occurs when the
information on a page
is purposely changed to
be incorrect or
misleading. For
example, after South
African swimmer Chad
Le Clos received a
silver medal at the
2016 Olympics, his
Wikipedia page was
edited to state that he
“died at the hands of
Michael Phelps, being
literally blown out of the
water by the greatest
American since
Abraham Lincoln.”
Privacy: Privacy
concerns have been

unknown people
receive Wikipedia

personal information

UNIT

11.3 Privacy and Information sharing
INTRODUCTION
Privacy is defined as a person’s ability to control how information about them is
shared with other people or institutions.
In South Africa, the privacy of all individuals is protected in Section 14 of the
constitution. Furthermore, the Protection of Personal Information Act (or POPI
Act) ensures that citizens’ personal information (such as ID numbers, addresses
and telephone numbers) may only be used in very specific circumstances.

Did you know
If you have ever received a
telemarketing call, then you
know that one of the
companies you pay (like
your bank, cellphone
provider or satellite
television subscription) sold
your contact information to
a telemarketing company.

Privacy becomes a very complicated issue on the internet. Companies who
provide services to you for free (like Facebook and Google) often collect
information about you when you use these services and sell that information to
advertisers.
These companies do not break the law, but rather make sure they follow the letter
of the law exactly. They may include a section on how your personal information
will be used in the 30-page terms and conditions agreement you sign when you
sign-up for their service, or they may ask you who to share information with any
time you make a post. However, by using their services, you allow them to sell
your information.
In the following section, you will learn more about issues related to privacy and
anonymity. Specifically, you will learn how cookies can be used to invade your
privacy and the impact of online anonymity.

QR CODE

COOKIES
This has been explained in detail in Chapter 1. Let’s revise this topic briefly. A
cookie is a small amount of data generated by a website and saved by your web
browser. Its purpose is to remember information about you, similar to a preference
file created by a software application.

ANONYMITY
As you know, most websites allow people to use them anonymously. Even when
they require people to create accounts, very few websites require people to prove
their identity. As a result, people can create accounts with any name or surname
they want. This allows greater freedom of expression, but also less accountability
for any comments made.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I GRADE 12 I Theory Book

Anonymity offers the following advantages to internet users:
●●
It allows people to be more honest and have more honest conversations.
●●
It allows people to give and receive more honest feedback.
●●
It allows people to seek help and support on personal or embarrassing
issues.
●●
It allows people to have more balanced conversations with all anonymous
users being treated equally.
●●
It allows people to anonymously whistle blow on illegal activities.
However, due to a lack of accountability, anonymity also has several disadvantages:
●●
It can protect people committing crimes or gathering information about
illegal activities.
●●
It can be used for legal but unethical activities.
●●
It can be used to make statements that are not socially acceptable, without
fear of censure.
●●
It can be used to target and bully specific people.
In 2011, Google implemented a “real names only” policy on Google+ (its social
network). This name would then be used across the range of Google’s services,
including Gmail and YouTube. The internet was furious and campaigned against
the policy for months. After almost a year, Google softened the policy before
removing it completely in 2014.

Did you know
In 1999, companies
realised that each
document created in
Microsoft Office contained
a global unique identifier
(or GUID) which could be
linked to specific
computers. As a result,
employees across the world
who believed they had
anonymously shared
private information or had
revealed how their
companies were breaking
the law, lost their jobs as
their identities were
revealed.

Activity 11.8
11.8.1 In your opinion, are cookies beneficial or not? Explain.
11.8.2 In 2014, the game developer Zoë Quinn was the target of intense online
harassment in a controversy known as Gamergate. As part of the harassment, Zoë’s
personal information (including her home address) was posted publicly on the
internet while she was receiving thousands of death threats.
Zoë was targeted for harassment because she created a game called Depression
Quest which helped people to understand depression. This was not a “proper” game
according to some internet users. The harassment then became significantly worse
when Zoë’s ex-boyfriend falsely accused her of having a relationship with a gaming
journalist to get a positive review for Depression Quest.
Gamergate highlights many of the problems with online anonymity, including
bullying and harassment by anonymous online users. However, it also shows how
removing anonymity can cause problems, with the harassment becoming personal
and threatening once Zoë’s personal relationships and home address were placed
on the internet. Answer the following questions:
a. Do you think it is important to keep the internet anonymous?
b. Do you think cyberbullying is something that occurs within your school or
community?
c. Would you feel comfortable linking everything you have done on the internet to
your real name and surname?
d. Are there any kinds of websites that should force people to use their real name?
e. How would they ensure that users use their real name and surname?

GLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS
A GUID (global unique identifier) is a term used by Microsoft. It is a number that its programming generates
to create a unique identity for an entity such as a Word document.
GUIDs are widely used in Microsoft products to identify interfaces, replica sets, records, and other objects.
One concern is that an author of a document can be traced by the GUID in the document, even in
circumstances where the author has taken care to maintain their anonymity.

FILE SHARING (MOVIES, MUSIC)
The internet is quickly becoming many users preferred source of music, films and other forms of
entertainment.
File-sharing sites can cause problems in three ways:
●●
The free-to-use ones are probably breaching copyright laws (either downloading or uploading is illegal).
●●
Some sites are used to distribute pornography, racist or other inappropriate or unlawful material,
often masked as respectable content.
●●
These services also enable strangers to gain access to areas of your or your child’s computer,
leaving it open to viruses, spyware and ‘botnet’ software.
